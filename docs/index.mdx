# Introduction

Welcome to the Solidus developer documentation!

[Solidus](https://solidus.io) is the open-source eCommerce framework for industry trailblazers.
Built on top of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), Solidus is designed to be completely
customizable: every aspect of the framework can be extended, changed or replaced based on your
needs.

Today, Solidus is used in production by some of the world's most renowned brands to power their
eCommerce experiences.
