# Release the extension

:::info
This step is optional but recommended. You _could_ keep your extension in a private or public GitHub
repository and download it directly from there, but you'd miss out on the benefits of properly
versioning your extension, which makes it easier to maintain and upgrade it.
:::

Like all gems, Solidus extensions can be released to any public or private gem servers, such
as [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) or [Gemfury](https://gemfury.com/). Releasing your extension
allows you to package it in a convenient way and follow an established versioning scheme much more
easily than simply pulling code from GitHub. In general, you should release the first version of
your extension as soon as you start using it in production.

By default, the extension skeleton generated by `solidus_dev_support` is configured to release your
gem on RubyGems. If you're using a different gem server, they should provide instructions on how to
properly configure your gemspec.

Once you've configured your gem server you can release your extension with the following command:

```
$ gem bump -v 1.0.0 -t # bump the extension version to 1.0.0
$ bin/rake changelog # generate the new release's changelog
$ git commit -a --amend # update the version bump commit
$ git push --follow-tags # push the version bump to GitHub
$ gem release # release the extension on the gem server
```

:::danger

The `bin/rake changelog` command will work as long as you're hosting your repository on GitHub.
Otherwise, you need to manually create it or use another tool.

You might also need to [generate a new GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and
provide it as an environment variable. E.g.: `CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN=my_token bin/rake changelog`\
See [github-changelog-generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator) (
used under the hood) for details.

In the Solidus ecosystem, we follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for assigning version
numbers to our releases. It is strongly recommended you do the same, in order not to break the
expectations of experienced Solidus developers.
