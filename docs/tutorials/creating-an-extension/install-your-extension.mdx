# Install your extension

Once you've released your extension (or just pushed it to GitHub), you can install it in any Solidus
store by following the [usual instructions](/concepts/extension-adoption.mdx). First, add the
extension to your Gemfile:

```ruby title="Gemfile"
# ...

# Use this if you released your extension to a gem server:
gem 'solidus_acme_fulfillment'

# Use this if you simply host your extension on GitHub:
gem 'solidus_acme_fulfillment', github: 'your-org/solidus_acme_fulfillment'
```

Then install the bundle:

```
$ bundle install
```

Finally, run your extension's install generator to copy all relevant files to your application:

```
$ bin/rails g solidus_acme_fulfillment:install
```

The generator will ask you whether to run migrations immediately. If you choose not to do it, you
can always do it yourself with `bin/rails db:migrate`.

As the last step, you may want to review and customize the files generated by your extension. In our
example, you should set your API key in the `config/initializers/solidus_acme_fulfillment.rb` file.

That's it! Your extension is now fully installed and running in your app.
