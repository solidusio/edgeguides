# Creating an extension

In this tutorial, we'll create an extension for integrating with Acme Fulfillment, a fulfillment
provider â€” this is a very common use case in eCommerce. Our extension will do the following:

1. When an order is finalized, it will call the fulfillment partner's API to send all information
   about the order, so that it can be packaged and shipped to the customer.
2. It will store the fulfillment partner's shipment ID in the Solidus DB, for easier inspection and
   debugging.

Let's dive right in!
