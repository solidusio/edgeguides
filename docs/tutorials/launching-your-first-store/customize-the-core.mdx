# Customize the core

This guide will teach you how to customize different aspects of Solidus' business logic, as well
as the different techniques for doing so.

## Customization strategies

Most Solidus stores don't stop at customizing the storefront: in fact, if all you need is a custom
storefront, perhaps Solidus is not a good choice in the first place. Solidus users want to be able
to customize every single aspect of their store, not just how the store appears to customers but
also what happens under the hood when customers browse it and place an order.

Because Solidus is built on Ruby and Ruby on Rails, there are no limits to what can be customized.
You can literally change every single aspect of the framework's business logic however you see fit,
either through built-in customization hooks or Ruby's powerful meta-programming features.

How you customize Solidus will have implications for the stability and maintainability of your
store, so it's good to know the set of tools at your disposal and make an informed decision
depending on your specific use case. In most cases, you'll want to adopt a mix of these approaches.

### Using built-in hooks

Solidus provides a rich and powerful API for customizing different aspects of your store's business
logic. By defining which classes get called to perform certain tasks in your store, you have the
option to either enrich or completely replace Solidus' default functionality.

The [`Spree::AppConfiguration`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/lib/spree/app\_configuration.rb)
class has a list of all the service object classes that can be natively customized. Look for through
the source code of that class and see if there's an option that resembles what you need to do. If
yes, bingo!

:::info

`Spree::AppConfiguration` is not the only configuration class that contains service objects. Before
resorting to other customization methods, search through Solidus' source code and see if there are
any other options that allow you to replace the class you need.

:::

For instance, Solidus merges a user's "guest" cart with the cart associated to their user account
when they sign in. Let's suppose you don't like this default behavior, and would like to keep the
two carts separate at all times instead, to avoid confusion for the user. You can see there
is [an option](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/lib/spree/app\_configuration.rb#L372)
in the configuration that allows us to control precisely this behavior:

```ruby title="solidus/core/lib/spree/app_configuration.rb"
# Allows providing your own class for merging two orders.
#
# @!attribute [rw] order_merger_class
# @return [Class] a class with the same public interfaces
#   as Spree::OrderMerger.
class_name_attribute :order_merger_class, default: 'Spree::OrderMerger'
```

Let's also take a look at
the [default `Spree::OrderMerger` class](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/475d9db5d0291dd4aeddc58ec919988c336729bb/core/app/models/spree/order\_merger.rb)
to understand what public API Solidus expects us to implement in our custom version:

```ruby title="solidus/core/app/models/spree/order_merger.rb"
module Spree
  class OrderMerger
    # ...

    def initialize(order)
      # ...
    end

    def merge!(other_order, user = nil)
      # ...
    end

    # ...
  end
end
```

As you can see, the order merger exposes two public methods:

* `#initialize`, which accepts an order.
* `#merge!`, which accepts another order to merge with the first one and (optionally) the current
user.

Equipped with this information, we can now write our "nil" order merger:

```ruby title="app/models/amazing_store/nil_order_merger.rb"
module AmazingStore
  class NilOrderMerger
    attr_reader :order

    def initialize(order)
      @order = order
    end

    def merge!(other_order, user = nil)
      order.associate_user!(user) if user
    end
  end
end
```

Finally, now that we have the new merger, we need to tell Solidus to use it:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...
  config.order_merger_class = 'AmazingStore::NilOrderMerger'
end
```

Restart your application server, and Solidus should start using your shiny new order merger!

:::warning

When overriding critical functionality, you may also want to make sure that your feature is working
correctly in integration. The unit test we have written, for instance, doesn't guarantee in any way
that our custom order merger responds to the expected public API and will not break as soon as
Solidus tries to call it.

:::

### Using overrides

Solidus is a large and complex platform and, while new built-in customization hooks and events are
introduced all the time to make the platform easier to extend, there may be situations where Solidus
doesn't provide an official API to customize what you need. When that's the case, Ruby's
meta-programming features come to the rescue, allowing you to extend and/or override whatever you
want.

As an example, suppose you want to introduce an environment variable that allows you to temporarily
make all products unavailable in the storefront.

When you look at Solidus' source code, you will notice that `Spree::Product` already has
an [`#available?`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/product.rb#L171)
method to control a product's visibility. This is the original implementation:

```ruby
# Determines if product is available. A product is available if it has not
# been deleted and the available_on date is in the past.
#
# @return [Boolean] true if this product is available
def available?
  !deleted? && available_on&.past? && !discontinued?
end
```

As you can see, there is no "clean" way we can extend this method: no built-in customization hooks
or events that can help us.

However, we can still use plain old Ruby and the power
of [`Module#prepend`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.1/Module.html#method-i-prepend). If you're not
familiar with it, `#prepend` is a method that allows us to insert a module at the beginning of
another module's ancestors chain. Think of it as taking a module A and placing it "in front" of
another module B: when you call a method on module B, Ruby will first hit module A and then continue
down the chain of ancestors.

In the Solidus ecosystem, we call **overrides** to the modules that are prepended**.** Overrides are
usually named in a descriptive way that expresses how the override extends the original class.

:::info

The Solidus ecosystem used to rely heavily on `#class_eval` for overrides, but `#prepend` is a
cleaner and more easily maintainable approach. You may see old guides, tutorials and extensions
still using `#class_eval`, but you should know this is a deprecated pattern.

:::

:::warning

If you're not yet in Ruby 3 and you're prepending a module, take note that if Rails includes the
module before the `prepend` is called, then Rails might not be able to include the prepended
behavior. This might happen if you're prepending a views helper or an ActiveSupport concern. For
these cases, you might have no choice but to use `#class_eval` to override the module. For more
information, please
see [Module.prepend does not work nicely with included modules](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/issues/3371).

:::

To begin with, you need to set up the directory where you'll place your overrides so that Rails can
pick them up:

```ruby title="config/application.rb"
overrides = "#{Rails.root}/app/overrides"
Rails.autoloaders.main.ignore(overrides)
config.to_prepare do
  Dir.glob("#{overrides}/**/*.rb").each do |override|
    load override
  end
end
```

In our example, we can customize the `Spree::Product#available?` method by writing a module that
will be prepended to `Spree::Product`. Here's our `AddGlobalHiddenFlag` override:

```ruby title="app/overrides/amazing_store/spree/product/add_global_hidden_flag.rb"
module AmazingStore
  module Spree
    module Product
      module AddGlobalHiddenFlag
        def available?
          ENV['MAKE_PRODUCTS_UNAVAILABLE'] == false && super
        end

        ::Spree::Product.prepend self
      end
    end
  end
end
```

As you can see, we are not only able to override the default `#available?` implementation, but we
can also call the original implementation with `super`. This allows you to decide whether you want
to extend the original method or completely override it.

:::warning

You should always prefer customizing Solidus via public, standardized APIs such as the built-in
customization hooks and the event bus, whenever possible. When you use a supported API, it's much
less likely your customization will be broken by a future upgrade that changes the part of the code
you are overriding.

:::

### Using the event bus

Please, take a look at the [Subscribing to events](/reference/event-bus.mdx) chapter for a complete
description of the Event Bus on Solidus.
