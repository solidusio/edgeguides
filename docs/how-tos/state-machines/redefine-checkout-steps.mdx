# Redefine checkout steps

Solidus comes bundled with a robust checkout system that caters to the needs of the majority of
eCommerce stores. However, this system doesn't fit the needs for every business.

In this guide, we'll cover the steps you need to take to customize the checkout flow in your Solidus
store.

## The default checkout flow

The default Solidus checkout flow follows these steps, from start to finish:

1. Cart
2. Address
3. Delivery
4. Payment (if needed)
5. Confirm
6. Complete

## Removing checkout steps

You'll need to decorate the order model to add or remove checkout steps. Inside the decorator, you
just need to add `remove_checkout_step` and pass in the name of the step you want to remove. For
example, if you wanted to remove the address step, your decorator might look like this:

```ruby title="app/decorators/my_app/spree/order_decorator.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

module MyApp
  module Spree
    module OrderDecorator
      def self.prepended(base)
        base.remove_checkout_step :address
      end

      ::Spree::Order.prepend self
    end
  end
end
```

Please keep in mind the following caveats for removing checkout steps:

* If you remove the address step but keep the delivery step, the delivery step will break, as it
expects the order to have an address.
* If you remove the payment step but the order has a positive balance, the order will not be able to
complete.

## Adding checkout steps

If you want to add a custom checkout step, you will need to call `add_checkout_step` in the order
decorator, and pass in your custom step name, as well as a `before` or `after` attribute, so that
the order state machine knows where to put this custom step in the checkout flow.

```ruby title="app/decorators/my_app/spree/order_decorator.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

module MyApp
  module Spree
    module OrderDecorator
      def self.prepended(base)
        base.insert_checkout_step :my_custom_step, {before: :confirm}
      end

      ::Spree::Order.prepend self
    end
  end
end
```

You will also need to add a view for this custom step:

```erb title="app/views/spree/checkout/_my_custom_step.html.erb"
<div>
  The customer will see this partial when they are on your checkout step.
  Be sure to add a continue button!
</div>

<div class="form-buttons" data-hook="buttons">
  <%= submit_tag t('spree.save_and_continue'), class: 'continue button primary' %>
  <script>Spree.disableSaveOnClick();</script>
</div>
```

And finally, our step needs a translation that Solidus will display to the user:

```yaml title="config/locales/en.yml"
en:
  spree:
    order_state:
      my_custom_step: My Custom Step
```

### Before step action

Before proceeding to any step, the checkout controller will check to see if a method
named `before_#{checkout_step_name}` exists. If it does, it runs that method. That means that you
can run custom logic before the controller moves on to your step, which can be handy if you want to
set things up for the view.

```ruby title="app/controllers/my_app/checkout_controller_decorator.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

module MyApp
  module CheckoutControllerDecorator
    def before_my_custom_step
      @custom_object = CustomObject.new()
    end

    ::Spree::CheckoutController.prepend self
  end
end
```

### Checkout Controller Attributes

If you need to permit additional attributes for your custom step, you can add the attributes to
the `checkout_confirm_attributes` set in an initializer.

```ruby title="config/initializers/my_app_initializer.rb"
Spree::PermittedAttributes.checkout_my_custom_step_attributes << [:my_custom_attribute]
```

:::danger

**The attribute set that is used changes depending on the step**: `payment`
uses `checkout_payment_attributes`, `address` uses `checkout_address_attributes`, and so
on. `checkout_confirm_attributes` is used for the confirm step, and for any step that the checkout
controller does not recognize - like our new custom step.

:::

## Conditional checkout steps

You can conditionally include steps in the checkout flow if necessary, by passing a conditional in
with the step in `add_checkout_step`. For example, if we only want to include our custom step if the
orders total is over $50, we can pass that requirement in as a conditional:

```ruby title="app/decorators/my_app/spree/order_decorator.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

module MyApp
  module Spree
    module OrderDecorator
      def self.prepended(base)
        base.insert_checkout_step :my_custom_step, {
          before: :confirm, if: -> (order) { order.total > 50 }
        }
      end

      ::Spree::Order.prepend self
    end
  end
end
```

Now the custom step will only be displayed during checkout if the order total is above $50.00.

## Overriding the state machine

If the customization options above are still not enough, you can override the entire state machine
and use your own. We recommend that your new state machine inherit from the old one, so that you can
utilize some of the logic of the old state machine.

First of all, you will have to define your own state machine:

```ruby title="lib/my_app/state_machine.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

require 'spree/core/state_machines/order'

module MyApp
  class StateMachine
    module Order
      include ::Spree::Core::StateMachines::Order

      module ClassMethods
        include ::Spree::Core::StateMachines::Order::ClassMethods

        def define_state_machine!
          # Go crazy!
        end
      end

      def self.included(klass)
        klass.extend ClassMethods
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Once it's defined, you just need to tell Solidus to use it:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  config.state_machines.order = "MyApp::StateMachine::Order"

  # ....
end
```
