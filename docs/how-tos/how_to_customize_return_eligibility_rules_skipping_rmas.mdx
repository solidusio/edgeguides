# How to customize return eligibility rules: skipping RMAs

Solidus' [built-in process for returns][returns] is mighty and flexible, and
even allows you to disable RMAs as a prerequisite to creating a customer
return.

Go ahead and create an order from the storefront. You must go through
the entire checkout process, from adding items to the cart to confirming the
payment.

Next, you need to capture the payments in the system and perform the shipments.
You can do it either from the admin panel or through the console. E.g.:

```ruby
order = Spree::Order.find_by_number('R723438584')
order.payments.map(&:capture!)
order.shipments.map(&:ship!)
```

Let us go to the heart of the matter. When you add return items to a customer's
return, Solidus checks whether they are eligible for being returned. By
default, it uses
[`Spree::ReturnItem::EligibilityValidator::Default`][eligibility-validator-default].
Even if you can [replace it altogether][configure-eligibility-validator], the
default validator is flexible enough to allow us to skip only the requirement
for an RMA.

Take a look at the stack of steps that `EligibilityValidator::Default` calls:

```ruby title="core/app/models/spree/return_item/eligibility_validator/default.rb"
# ...
self.permitted_eligibility_validators = [
  ReturnItem::EligibilityValidator::OrderCompleted,
  ReturnItem::EligibilityValidator::TimeSincePurchase,
  ReturnItem::EligibilityValidator::RMARequired,
  ReturnItem::EligibilityValidator::InventoryShipped,
  ReturnItem::EligibilityValidator::NoReimbursements
]
# ...
```

Let's use the Solidus initializer to remove the unwanted one:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
# ...
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  ::Spree::ReturnItem::EligibilityValidator::Default.permitted_eligibility_validators.delete(
    ::Spree::ReturnItem::EligibilityValidator::RMARequired
  )
end
# ...
```

And that's it! You can now simplify the return flow by creating customer
returns without going through a previous authorization. You can go ahead and
check it out in the admin panel.
