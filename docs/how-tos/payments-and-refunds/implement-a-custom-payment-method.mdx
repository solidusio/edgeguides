# Implement a custom payment method

In the next paragraphs, we'll see how to customize different aspects of Solidus' payment system.

Note that this is an advanced use case and is only required in very specific scenarios. In most
cases, you'll be better off using one of the existing payment integrations.

## Custom payment gateways

:::info

Most payment integrations in Solidus don't ship with a custom payment gateway. Instead, they rely on
one of the payment gateways provided
by [ActiveMerchant](https://github.com/activemerchant/active\_merchant).

If you need to integrate with a PSP that's not supported by Solidus, you should first look and see
whether ActiveMerchant already provides the payment gateway you need: if that's the case, you will
only need to implement a custom payment method and source.

:::

Implementing a custom payment gateway can be useful if you're integrating with a lesser-known PSP (
e.g., a local PSP in your country), or if you need to deeply customize an existing PSP integration.

### The payment gateway API

Payment gateways expose the following API:

* `#initialize(options)`: initializes the gateway with the provided options. By default, Solidus
will pass
the [payment method's preferences](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment\_method.rb#L78)
in here.
* `#authorize(money, source, options = {})`: authorizes a certain amount on the provided payment
source.
* `#capture(money, transaction_id, options = {})`: captures a certain amount from a previously
authorized transaction.
* `#purchase(money, source, options = {})`: authorizes and captures a certain amount on the provided
payment source.
* `#void(transaction_id, [source,] options = {})`: voids a previously authorized transaction,
releasing the funds that are on hold. The `source` parameter is only needed for payment gateways
that support payment profiles.
* `#credit(money, [source,] transaction_id, options = {})`: refunds the provided amount on a
previously captured transaction. The `source` parameter is only needed for payment gateways that
support payment profiles.

All of these methods are expected to return
an [`ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response`](https://github.com/activemerchant/active\_merchant/blob/v3.0/lib/active\_merchant/billing/response.rb)
object containing the result and details of the operation. Payment gateways never raise exceptions
when things go wrong: they only return response objects that represent successes or failures, and
Solidus handles control flow accordingly.

:::caution

For historical and technical reasons, the Solidus API for payment gateways deviates from the
ActiveMerchant API in a few ways:

* The `source` parameter that is passed to a gateway will be an instance of `Spree::PaymentSource`,
while ActiveMerchant gateways expect their own models.
* The `#void` and `#credit` method in ActiveMerchant never accepts a payment source. Solidus will
pass the payment source to `#void` and `#credit` if the payment method supports payment profiles.
* The `#credit` method in ActiveMerchant gateways does not accept a transaction ID but a payment
method token (e.g., credit card token), since it can be used to credit funds to a payment source
even in the absence of a previous charge. What Solidus calls `#credit` is actually
called `#refund` in ActiveMerchant.

For custom payment gateways, these discrepancies are not a problem, since the gateways can be
implemented to respond to the API expected by Solidus.

For ActiveMerchant gateways, the payment method will wrap these methods instead of delegating them
to the gateway directly, and will transform the method calls and their arguments to comply with
ActiveMerchant's interface.

:::

### Building your gateway

To build your gateway, you just need to create a new class that responds to the Gateway API. In this
example, we'll build a new payment gateway for our beloved SolidusPay which provides a nice RESTful
API for managing payments and refunds.

The first step would be to build the skeleton of our gateway. For the time being, we'll just make
sure we store the API key that's passed when initializing the gateway, and we'll write a small
helper on top of the HTTParty gem for interacting with the PSP's API:

```ruby title="app/models/solidus:pay/gateway.rb"
module SolidusPay
  class Gateway
    API_URL = 'https://soliduspay.com/api/v1'

    attr_reader :api_key

    def initialize(options)
      @api_key = options.fetch(:api_key)
    end

    private

    def request(method, uri, body = {})
      HTTParty.send(
        method,
        "#{API_URL}#{uri}",
        headers: {
          "Authorization" => "Bearer #{api_key}",
          "Content-Type" => "application/json",
          "Accept" => "application/json",
        },
        body: body.to_json,
      )
    end
  end
end
```

Now that we have everything we need to interact with the API, we can start writing the actual
integration. The first step in processing a payment is usually authorizing it, so we'll start with
that:

```ruby title="app/models/solidus:pay/gateway.rb"
module SolidusPay
  class Gateway
    # ...

    def authorize(money, auth_token, options = {})
      response = request(
        :post,
        "/charges",
        payload_for_charge(money, auth_token, options).merge(capture: false),
      )

      if response.success?
        ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response.new(
          true,
          "Transaction Authorized",
          {},
          authorization: response.parsed_response['id'],
        )
      else
        ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response.new(
          false,
          response.parsed_response['error'],
        )
      end
    end

    private

    # ...

    def payload_for_charge(money, auth_token, options = {})
      {
        auth_token: auth_token,
        amount: money,
        currency: options[:currency],
        description: "Payment #{options[:order_id]}",
        billing_address: options[:billing_address],
      }
    end
  end
end
```

The logic for the `#authorize` method is fairly straightforward: it makes a POST request to
the `/api/v1/charges` endpoint of the PSP's API. The body of the request includes information about:

* the amount we want to charge, which is passed in the `amount` parameter as a number of cents (
e.g., `1000` represents 10.00, `1050` represents 10.50),
* the payment source we want to charge, which is passed in the `auth_token` parameter,
* [metadata about the order and the payment](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment/processing.rb#L91)
, which is passed in the `options` parameter.

The method then returns an `ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response` object that represents the success or
failure of the operation. In the successful response, the `:authorization` option will also be
included. Solidus will store the value of this option on the `response_code` attribute on
the `Spree::Payment` record, so that we can reference the transaction ID when
capturing/voiding/refunding it later.

You'll notice that the payload of the request is generated in a helper method, `#payload_for_charge`
. This is because the payloads for authorizing and purchasing (i.e., authorizing and capturing in
one go) is the same, minus the `:capture` option, which we'll set to `true` when we also want to
capture the amount:

```ruby title="app/models/solidus:pay/gateway.rb"
module SolidusPay
  class Gateway
    # ...

    def purchase(money, auth_token, options = {})
      response = request(
        :post,
        "/charges",
        payload_for_charge(money, auth_token, options).merge(capture: true),
      )

      if response.success?
        ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response.new(
          true,
          "Transaction Purchased",
          {},
          authorization: response.parsed_response['id'],
        )
      else
        ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response.new(
          false,
          response.parsed_response['error'],
        )
      end
    end

    # ...
  end
end
```

:::info

Some PSPs, such as Stripe, provide a single endpoint for authorizing and capturing a payment in one
request. Others will require you to perform two different requests, in which case your `#purchase`
method may simply call `#authorize` and `#capture` in succession.

:::

The rest of our gateway (`#capture`, `#void` and `#credit`) is trivial and pretty similar to our
existing methods. We just call our PSP to perform a certain operation on an existing transaction:

```ruby title="app/models/solidus:pay/gateway.rb"
module SolidusPay
  class Gateway
    # ...

    def capture(money, transaction_id, options = {})
      response = request(
        :post,
        "/charges/#{transaction_id}/capture",
        { amount: money },
      )

      if response.success?
        ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response.new(true, "Transaction Captured")
      else
        ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response.new(
          false,
          response.parsed_response['error'],
        )
      end
    end

    def void(transaction_id, options = {})
      response = request(:post, "/charges/#{transaction_id}/refunds")

      if response.success?
        ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response.new(true, "Transaction Voided")
      else
        ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response.new(
          false,
          response.parsed_response['error'],
        )
      end
    end

    def credit(money, transaction_id, options = {})
      response = request(
        :post,
        "/charges/#{transaction_id}/credit",
        { amount: money },
      )

      if response.success?
        ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response.new(true, "Transaction Credited")
      else
        ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response.new(
          false,
          response.parsed_response['error'],
        )
      end
    end

    # ...
  end
end
```

At this point, we have our custom payment gateway which encapsulates all API interaction logic with
the PSP, and we can use it as part of a custom payment method.

## Custom payment sources

:::info

Not all payment methods require a custom payment source. Instead, you may want to simply rely on the
existing [`Spree::CreditCard`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/credit\_card.rb)
payment source, which provides some useful logic for working with "credit card" types of payment
sources.

:::

Creating a custom payment source may be needed if you are integrating with a new PSP that is not
credit-card based. This will be the case, for instance, when a customer pays through their PSP
account's balance rather than via a specific credit card (e.g., "Pay with PayPal"). It's also a
common setup with financing PSPs such as Affirm or AfterPay: in this case, the PSP itself is the "
source" of money.

### The payment source API

Payment sources respond to a very simple API which tells Solidus what operations can or cannot be
performed on the payment source. Solidus will use this information to display/hide certain actions
on the backend, or to control the order processing flow:

* `#actions`: returns an array of actions that can _generally_ be performed on payments with this
payment source. `capture`, `void` and `credit` are standard supported actions, but you can also
have custom actions here, as long as `Spree::Payment` responds to them.
* `#can_<action>?`: for each of the actions returned by `#actions`, Solidus will attempt to call
this method to verify whether that action can be taken on a payment, which will be passed to the
method as the only
argument. [Default implementations](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment\_source.rb#L21)
are provided for `capture`, `void` and `credit` which check the payment's state.
* `#reusable?`: whether this payment source is reusable (i.e., whether it can be used on future
orders as well). Solidus will use this to determine whether to add the payment source to the
user's wallet after the order is placed, and to determine which sources to show from the user's
wallet during the checkout flow.

Next, let's see how exactly to implement these methods in a brand new payment source.

### Building a custom payment source

For example, let's say we're integrating with a brand new PSP called SolidusPay which allows
customers to pay with their SolidusPay account's balance, similar to what happens with PayPal. In
order to model this behavior, we'll need a custom payment source model, which will be much simpler
than the default credit card payment source.

The first step is to generate a new model, which we'll call `SolidusPay::Transaction`.

Our model will just have a `payment_method_id` column, which will be used to associate the payment
source to the payment method that generated it, and an `auth_token` column, which we'll use to store
the ID of the SolidusPay auth token that we will later charge:

```bash
$ rails g model SolidusPay::Transaction payment_method_id:integer auth_token:string
$ rails db:migrate
```

By default, Rails will generate a model that inherits from `ApplicationRecord`. Instead, we want our
model to inherit from `Spree::PaymentSource`, so that we can benefit from some sensible defaults
provided by Solidus for payment sources:

```diff title="app/models/solidus:pay/transaction.rb"
- class SolidusPay::Transaction < ApplicationRecord
+ class SolidusPay::Transaction < Spree::PaymentSource
+   self.table_name = "solidus_pay_transactions"
  end
```

At this point, we have our new payment source model ready. Now, let's implement the payment source
API, so that Solidus knows how to use our payment source during order processing (note that this
logic is taken verbatim from `Spree::PaymentSource`, other than the `#reusable?` method which would
normally return `false`):

```ruby title="app/models/solidus:pay/transaction.rb"
class SolidusPay::Transaction < Spree::PaymentSource
  # ...

  # SolidusPay payments can be captured, voided and refunded.
  def actions
    %w(capture void credit)
  end

  # A SolidusPay payment can be captured as long as it's in the checkout or pending state.
  def can_capture?(payment)
    payment.pending? || payment.checkout?
  end

  # We rely on the payment state machine to determine when a SolidusPay payment can be voided.
  def can_void?(payment)
    payment.can_void?
  end

  # A SolidusPay payment can be refunded if it's been captured and if the
  # un-refunded amount is greater than 0.
  def can_credit?(payment)
    payment.completed? && payment.credit_allowed > 0
  end

  # SolidusPay accounts can be used to pay on future orders as well.
  def reusable?
    true
  end
end
```

At this point, we have a new payment source and Solidus knows how to use it internally.

## Custom payment methods

Payment methods are what Solidus interacts with when processing payments and refunds. In order to
take advantage of a custom payment gateway, we'll also need a custom payment method.

### The payment method API

By
default, `Spree::PaymentMethod` [delegates](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment\_method.rb#L40)
all gateway-specific method calls to the gateway itself. You can choose to maintain this behavior,
or to wrap the calls and enrich them with your custom logic by re-defining the relevant methods (
e.g., `#authorize`, `#capture`, `#purchase` etc.).

A common setup is to code your payment gateway so that it doesn't have to know about payment sources
and can be used independently, while the payment method acts as a bridge between payment sources and
the calls to the payment gateway.

Payment methods also expose additional methods which are Solidus-specific and not part of the
standard gateway API. We'll see which in the next paragraphs.

### Building a custom payment method

The first step for building a custom payment method is to create a new model that inherits
from `Spree::PaymentMethod`. Unlike for payment sources, payment methods are all stored in one
table, so there's no need to use the model generator. Instead, we'll create the model class
directly, with the bare minimum that's needed to make it work:

```ruby title="app/models/solidus:pay/payment:method.rb"
class SolidusPay::PaymentMethod < Spree::PaymentMethod
end
```

After creating the model, it's a good idea to configure the translation for its name, so that
Solidus knows how to display the payment method's name properly in the backend:

```yaml title="config/locales/en.yml"
en:
  # ...

  activerecord:
    models:
      solidus_pay/payment_method: Solidus Pay
```

Now that we have our new payment method, we need to tell Solidus about its existence, so that
SolidusPay shows up when an admin attempts to configure a new payment method:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.environment.payment_methods << 'SolidusPay::PaymentMethod'
end
```

At this point, if you open your Solidus backend and navigate to Settings → Payments → New Payment
Method, you should see "Solidus pay" in the list of available payment methods:

![Payment methods](./images/payment-methods.png)

Fill in a name for your payment method ("Solidus Pay" will do just fine) and hit Create to create a
new instance of the payment method in your Solidus store.

:::info

It's common to need to store some credentials or other preferences associated with a payment method.
Please, see
the [section about statically configured models for details](/reference/model-preferences.mdx#static-preferences).

:::

At this point, however, the payment method is just an empty shell: it doesn't know anything about
the custom source or the custom gateway we have implemented. We still need to make some adjustments
in order to fully integrate it with our PSP.

### Integrating a custom payment source

The first step to a complete integration is to make our payment method aware of the custom payment
source model we have created earlier. This way, the payment method will know which sources to
retrieve and create during the checkout flow.

To integrate the payment method with our payment source, we'll implement the following methods:

* `#payment_source_class`: returns the payment source class the payment method works with.
* `#reusable_sources(order)`: given a payment source, returns whether the payment method can work
with it.
* `#supports?(source)`: \_\*\*\_given an order, returns the list of reusable sources on the order
for the payment method.

The implementation for these is pretty simple and self-explanatory:

```ruby
class SolidusPay::PaymentMethod < Spree::PaymentMethod
  # ...

  def payment_source_class
    SolidusPay::Transaction
  end

  def supports?(source)
    source.is_a?(payment_source_class)
  end

  def reusable_sources(order)
    return [] unless order.user

    order.user.wallet_payment_sources.map(&:payment_source).select do |source|
      supports?(source) && source.reusable?
    end
  end
end
```

### Integrating a custom payment gateway

In order to start using our custom payment gateway, we'll need to tell the payment method which
payment gateway class to initialize. We can do this by defining a `gateway_class` method on the
payment method:

```ruby
class SolidusPay::PaymentMethod < Spree::PaymentMethod
  # ...

  preference :api_key, :string

  def gateway_class
    SolidusPay::Gateway
  end
end
```

You will notice that we also added an `api_key` preference. This preference will be automatically
configurable via the payment method UI in the Solidus admin, and will be passed to the payment
gateway's `#initialize` method. By default, the payment method will delegate all `#authorize`
, `#capture`, `#purchase`, `#void` and `#credit` calls to the gateway.

However, there's one caveat: Solidus will pass instances of `SolidusPay::Source` to our payment
method when calling `#authorize` and `#capture`, but the gateway doesn't know anything about payment
sources and works directly with auth tokens instead. This makes the gateway independent of Solidus,
but it also means Solidus will pass the wrong type of argument to it.

To accommodate this discrepancy, we'll adjust the `#authorize` and `#capture` methods on the payment
method slightly, in order to transform payment sources into auth tokens:

```ruby
class SolidusPay::PaymentMethod < Spree::PaymentMethod
  # ...

  def authorize(money, source, options = {})
    gateway.authorize(money, source.auth_token, options)
  end

  def purchase(money, source, options = {})
    gateway.purchase(money, source.auth_token, options)
  end
end
```

Finally, we need to implement the `#try_void` method. This method is supposed to attempt to void a
payment or return `false` if the payment cannot be voided anymore (in which case, Solidus will issue
a refund instead):

```ruby
class SolidusPay::PaymentMethod < Spree::PaymentMethod
  # ...

  def try_void(payment)
    return false if payment.completed?

    void(payment.source.transaction_id)
  end
end
```

Our `try_void` implementation is pretty simple: if the payment has already been completed (i.e.,
it's been captured), we return `false` and let Solidus issue a refund. If the payment hasn't been
captured, we void the existing authorization instead.

### Providing payment method partials

:::caution

These partials assume that you haven't customized the backend, storefront or API in significant ways
which would prevent them from working/displaying properly. If you have applied extensive
customizations to either of these engines, make sure to adjust the partials accordingly!

:::

```ruby
class SolidusPay::PaymentMethod < Spree::PaymentMethod
  # ...

  def partial_name
    'solidus_pay'
  end
end
```

When you create a new payment method, Solidus has no idea how to actually display it in the
storefront, backend or API. You will need to provide payment method partials so that Solidus can use
them when displaying the SolidusPay payment method.

The first partial we'll implement is used by Solidus when displaying the SolidusPay payment form in
the checkout flow. We will just ask users for their SolidusPay auth token:

```markup title="app/views/spree/checkout/payment/:solidus:pay.html.erb"
<% param_prefix = "payment_source[#{payment_method.id}]" %>

<div class="field field-required">
  <%= label_tag "auth_token_#{payment_method.id}", 'SolidusPay Auth Token' %>
  <%= text_field_tag "#{param_prefix}[auth_token]", nil, { id: "auth_token_#{payment_method.id}" } %>
</div>
```

We'll also need to add `auth_token` as a permitted source attribute in order for
it to get accepted by `Spree::CheckoutController`:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb
Spree::PermittedAttributes.source_attributes << :auth_token
```

When users fill this form during checkout, Solidus will create a new `SolidusPayAccount` payment
source with the auth token provided by the user. In general, Solidus will copy all
the `#{param_prefix}[...]` attributes to the payment source, so you can add more columns to the
payment source model and Solidus will set them all as long as your field names are structured
properly.

:::caution

For the sake of simplicity, we are assuming paying via SolidusPay is as simple as providing your
auth token in clear text. In reality, things are usually slightly more complicated and require
integrating with a JS SDK or redirecting the user to an off-site page in order to get a payment
token. It doesn't matter how complex your payment scenario: as long as it results in a payment
source being created with the right information, Solidus can integrate with it.

:::

But what if our user already has a SolidusPay account in their wallet, and they want to use that
instead? That requires another partial:

```markup title="app/views/spree/checkout/existing:payment/:solidus:pay.html.erb"
<tr id="<%= dom_id(wallet_payment_source, 'solidus_pay') %>">
  <td><%= wallet_payment_source.payment_source.auth_token %></td>
  <td>
    <%= radio_button_tag "order[wallet_payment_source_id]", wallet_payment_source.id, default, class: "existing-cc-radio" %>
  </td>
</tr>
```

Here, we are simply showing a radio button which Solidus will render to the user for all SolidusPay
accounts. The user can check one of the radio boxes to pay with an existing payment source.

At this point, it's possible to pay with a new or existing SolidusPay account via the storefront.
Let's make sure the same can be done in the backend, for orders placed manually by an admin.

This is what the partial for the backend looks like:

```markup title="app/views/spree/admin/payments/source:forms/:solidus:pay.html.erb"
<fieldset class="no-border-bottom">
  <legend><%= payment_method.name %></legend>

  <% if previous_cards.any? %>
    <div class="field">
      <% previous_cards.each do |solidus_pay_account| %>
        <label>
          <%= radio_button_tag :card, solidus_pay_account.id, solidus_pay_account == previous_cards.first %>
          <%= solidus_pay_account.auth_token %>
          <br />
        </label>
      <% end %>

      <label>
        <%= radio_button_tag :card, 'new', false %>
        Use new SolidusPayAccount
      </label>
    </div>
  <% end %>

  <% param_prefix = "payment_source[#{payment_method.id}]" %>
  <div class="field">
    <%= label_tag "auth_token_#{payment_method.id}", 'Auth Token', class: 'required' %>
    <%= text_field_tag "#{param_prefix}[auth_token]", '', class: 'required fullwidth', id: "auth_token_#{payment_method.id}" %>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

As you can see, this partial covers both new and existing payment sources. The admin can either
select one of the existing payment sources, or they can enter the customer's SolidusPay auth token
to create a new payment source.

:::caution

For many payment sources, it won't be possible to create a new source from the backend (e.g., it
wouldn't make sense to let admins link a customer's PayPal account via the backend, since they
wouldn't have the customer's PayPal credentials). In this case, it's perfectly fine not to display
the form at all, and only let admins choose from existing payment sources.

:::

We need one more partial for the backend, which will be used by Solidus when displaying a payment
source's information to admins:

```markup title="app/views/spree/admin/payments/source:views/:solidus:pay.html.erb"
<fieldset>
  <legend align="center"><%= SolidusPayAccount.model_name.human %></legend>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-4">
      <dl>
        <dt>Auth token:</dt>
        <dd><%= payment.source.auth_token %></dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

Here, we are just displaying the SolidusPay auth token, so that admins can easily understand which
payment source was used on a particular payment.

Finally, the last partial is needed to display a payment source's information via the API. Again,
we'll just include the payment source's ID and the SolidusPay auth token, so that the payment source
can be properly rendered by e.g. a mobile/JS application that uses the Solidus API:

```ruby title="app/views/spree/api/payments/source:views/:solidus:pay.json.jbuilder"
json.call(payment_source, :id, :auth_token)
```

### Adding support for payment profiles

Payment methods in Solidus can support **payment profiles**. Payment profiles provide the ability to
vault a payment source, i.e. store its details permanently in the PSP so that it can be charged at a
later stage. If you've ever used Stripe, this would be the equivalent of creating a Stripe customer
associated to the credit card you're trying to charge (in fact, that's exactly what the Stripe
payment method in Solidus does!).

When a payment method supports payment profiles, Solidus will alter the usual payment processing
flow slightly to accommodate that:

* Right after creating a payment, Solidus
will [call](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment.rb#L28)
the `#create_payment_profile(payment)` method on the payment method. This method is supposed to
create a payment profile for the payment source on the payment, and save its details on the
payment source.
*

When [voiding](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/e878076f2ed670d07654ab6293a16588743f2fa6/core/app/models/spree/payment/processing.rb#L74)
or [refunding](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/refund.rb#L60) a
transaction, Solidus will pass the payment source to the `#void` or `#refund` call, so that the
payment gateway can include the payment profile ID in the PSP API call, if required by the PSP.

The first step for adding support for payment profiles is defining
the `#payment_profiles_supported?` method in our payment method:

```ruby
class SolidusPay::PaymentMethod < Spree::PaymentMethod
  # ...

  def payment_profiles_supported?
    true
  end
end
```

Next, we'll implement a `create_customer`method in our gateway, which accepts a SolidusPay auth
token and creates a new SolidusPay customer from it:

```ruby
class SolidusPay::Gateway
  # ...

  def create_customer(auth_token)
    request(
      :post,
      "/customers",
      auth_token: auth_token,
    ).parsed_response
  end
end
```

This method will return the customer's profile, and we'll assume that the customer ID we want to
store will be in the `id` key.

At this point, we'll need to add a column to our `SolidusPay::Transaction` model for storing the
SolidusPay customer ID:

```bash
$ rails g migration AddCustomerIdToSolidusPayTransactions customer_id:string
$ rails db:migrate
```

:::caution

At the moment, Solidus doesn't offer native data structures for associating multiple payment sources
to the same payment profile (e.g., associating the same Stripe customer to multiple credit cards).
However, this could easily be implemented as a custom functionality (e.g., by storing the Stripe
customer ID on the user rather than the payment source).

:::

Finally, we'll implement the `create_profile` method on the SolidusPay payment method. This method
will be called right after a new SolidusPay payment is created, and it should create a new
SolidusPay customer with the payment source associated to the payment method, and store its ID on
the corresponding transaction:

```ruby
class SolidusPay::PaymentMethod < Spree::PaymentMethod
  # ...

  def create_profile(payment)
    customer = gateway.create_customer(payment.auth_token)

    payment.source.update(customer_id: customer['id'])
  end
end
```

Solidus should now create a new customer profile in SolidusPay whenever we create a SolidusPay
payment, and the customer ID will be correctly associated to the payment source.

The last step is updating the payment gateway and payment method implementation: now that our
payment method supports payment profiles, Solidus will start passing the payment source as an
additional parameter to `#void` and `#credit`:

```diff
 class SolidusPay::Gateway
   # ...

-  def void(transaction_id, options = {})
+  def void(transaction_id, source, options = {})
     # ...
   end

-  def credit(money, source, transaction_id, options = {})
+  def credit(money, source, transaction_id, options = {})
     # ...
   end
 end
```

In our example, we are not doing anything with the `source` parameter and simply accept it so that
Solidus' method calls don't fail. In the real world, we may want to pass the customer ID to the
gateway along with the transaction ID, so that it can be included in the API payload.
