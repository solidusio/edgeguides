# Create a custom role

Let's start with something simple: we'll define a new `customer_service` role that has limited
access to the Solidus backend. Customer service representatives will only be able to display users,
products and stock locations.

The first step is to create the `Spree::Role` record that we'll use to store our role. In order to
do that, you can simply add the following to your seeds:

```ruby
# ...
Spree::Role.where(name: 'customer_service').first_or_create!
```

Then, run the seeds:

```bash
$ rails db:seeds
```

Now that you have defined your role, you just need to associate it with the desired permission sets
in your Solidus configuration. You can do this in the Solidus initializer:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...
  config.roles.assign_permissions :customer_service, [
    Spree::PermissionSets::OrderDisplay,
    Spree::PermissionSets::UserDisplay,
    Spree::PermissionSets::ProductDisplay,
  ]
end
```

Now, if you assign the `customer_service` role to a user and sign into the backend with their
credentials, you'll see that you only have limited access to user profiles, orders and products.
