# Extension adoption

This guide will teach you when, why and how to use Solidus extensions, and provide you with some
best practices for doing so.

## When to use extensions

When you first install Solidus, you will notice that the platform is complete but quite lean. There
aren't any toggles to enable shiny additional features. You get what you need to start an online
store, and nothing more. This is by design. We know that each brand's business domain and USP are
unique, and that they require a unique implementation approach. With that said, we also know that it
isn't always smart to reinvent the wheel, especially when you're dealing with a common problem that'
s already been solved.

The easiest and quickest way to augment the functionality of your store is through _extensions_.
These are gems or full-fledged Rails engines that provide additional functionality for Solidus by
extending and overriding parts of the core. The Solidus ecosystem has a lot of extensions for many
disparate tasks. There are extensions that add support for new payment providers or 3PL
integrations, extensions that enhance your store with social features and many, many more to choose
from.

In general, if there's already an extension that solves your problem, you should evaluate it before
attempting to roll your own solution. Reusing the work of the community will not only save you the
effort of a custom implementation, but will also make the community stronger.

With that said, you're strongly encouraged to customize Solidus on your own if none of the available
solutions work for you, and this is exactly where the platform shines. You may then decide whether
to keep your implementation private or, if you think the world could benefit from your work, to give
back to the community and open-source it.

There's also a third option: if an extension already exists and takes you 90% of the way to solving
your problem, consider submitting a patch to improve it and/or make it more flexible. This way, you
benefit from the community's efforts while also ending up with a solution that fits your own use
case perfectly.

## Extension governance

The Solidus community has a strict governance model around extension management and maintenance.
Extensions can be split into three big groups:

* **Official extensions:** these extensions are hosted in
the [solidusio](https://github.com/solidusio) GitHub organization. They provide critical pieces of
functionality that need to be working at all times \(e.g. payment providers, sales tax calculation
and a few other categories\). They are maintained by the core team and any contribution is
reviewed by the core team for correctness and completeness.
* **Community extensions:** these extensions are hosted in
the [solidusio-contrib](https://github.com/solidusio-contrib) GitHub organization. They provide
common pieces of functionality that, although useful, are usually not mission-critical. They are
maintained by the entire Solidus community, with each extension usually having its own
maintainer\(s\). The core team works on tools and automations that make their maintenance easier,
but doesn't commit to spending their time actively working on these extensions.
* **Third-party extensions:** these are extensions that live "in the wild", and are not hosted in
any of Solidus' GitHub organizations. They may be written by organizations or individuals that
were interested in Solidus and decided to open-source their efforts. As you may imagine, the
Solidus community has no control over the quality of these extensions, so you're encouraged to
review them on your own before installing them in your store.

:::info

Extensions may be "promoted" from one group to the other by popular demand \(e.g. a third-party
extension becoming a community extension because it's widely used, or a community extension becoming
an official extension because it's become critical for multiple stores\). If you want to propose a
promotion, ping someone from the core team in Slack.

## Finding the right extension

You can find many useful extensions on the [Extensions](https://solidus.io/extensions) page of the
Solidus website, along with their CI status and supported Solidus versions. You can also filter by
extension type \(official, community or third-party\), which is useful if you want your extensions
to come with certain guarantees.

If you haven't found what you're looking for, you should still search on Google, GitHub
and [The Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/): new extensions are born every day and the one
you need may be out there!

## Installing an extension

:::caution

As a general rule, you should ALWAYS review any code that goes into your application. While Solidus
has strict policies around code reviews, you should go the extra mile and ensure any extensions
you're installing are safe and production-ready.

:::

The process for installing a Solidus extension is usually pretty simple and similar to the
installation of the platform itself \(after all, extensions are also Rails engines\). The first step
is always adding the extension to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby title="Gemfile"
gem 'solidus'
gem 'solidus_auth_devise'
# ...
gem 'solidus_amazing_extension'
```

Note that some extensions may have an outdated release on RubyGems or may not have been released
yet, in which case you'll want to pull the extensions directly from GitHub:

```ruby
gem 'solidus'
gem 'solidus_auth_devise'
# ...
gem 'solidus_amazing_extension', github: 'solidusio/solidus_amazing_extension'
```

Once you have added the gem, install your bundle:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Once the extension has been installed, simply follow the instructions in the extension's
documentation. You may have to run an installation generator and run database migrations if the
extension alters the database's schema.

:::info

The order gems appear in your `Gemfile` is important in the case of Solidus extensions. Make sure
extensions are always added after the `solidus` and `solidus_auth_devise` gems, so that any
overrides in the extension are applied correctly.

## Staying up-to-date

Just like the core, extensions are constantly updated to add new features, enhance existing
functionality, fix bugs and add compatibility with new Solidus versions. It's extremely important to
keep your extensions up to date with the same diligence you reserve for the rest of your
application. You should have a clear process in place for continuously updating extensions. The
easier it is to update extensions, the likelier it is you will be doing it early and often.

The recommended approach is to write automated tests for any functionality added by extensions to
your store. While extensions may have their own test suites, you cannot always predict how an
extension will interact with your store's customizations or with other extensions. Furthermore, it's
always best to test functionality in integration and in the context of your own app.

It's also recommended NOT to add any version constraints to extensions in your `Gemfile`. Instead,
rely on your tests to ensure nothing's broken after an update. Ideally, the update process should be
as simple as running the following commands:

```bash
$ bundle update
$ bundle exec rspec
```

Of course, this is not always possible and there may be situations where you need to lock an
extension, but we recommend keeping these to a minimum.
