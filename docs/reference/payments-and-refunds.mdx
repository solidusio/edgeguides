# Payments and refunds

:::info

This guide covers the architecture and functionality of payments and refunds in Solidus, which is
useful when you need to customize the payment flow or integrate with a custom payment gateway.
However, Solidus comes with integrations for the major payment service providers. If that's what
you're looking for, check out
our [Payments](https://solidus.io/extensions/#extensions-group-payments) extensions.

## Domain concepts

Solidus comes with a modular, powerful system for managing payments and refunds.

The system is designed in layers, with each layer wrapping the one below to perform an additional
level of abstraction. This allows for more granular customization, and makes it flexible enough that
it can be adapted to any kind of payment service provider and payment/refunds flow.

In the next paragraphs, we'll go through the main pieces that make up Solidus' payment system, and
give an overview of how they work with each other.

### Payment gateways

Payment gateways are the smallest unit of the payment system: each payment gateway provides the
logic for integrating with the API of a specific PSP (Payment Service Provider).

Most payment gateways are built on top
of [ActiveMerchant](https://github.com/activemerchant/active\_merchant), a popular Ruby library for
integrating with PSPs. You can learn more about the architecture on
the [ActiveMerchant documentation](https://github.com/activemerchant/active\_merchant/wiki).

### Payment sources

:::info

Credit cards are the most common example of payment sources, and Solidus provide a
good [out-of-the-box implementation](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/credit\_card.rb)
for credit-card-based payment sources.

:::

[Payment sources](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment\_source.rb)
, as the name suggests, are models whose purpose is to store information about the different ways a
user can pay.

Each payment source is backed by its own DB table and exposes different information to Solidus about
the actions that can be taken on it and whether it is reusable for future payments.

Reusable payment sources can be added to a
user's [wallet](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/wallet.rb), in
which case they can be picked by the user for future checkouts as well.

### Payment methods

:::info

Solidus provides out-of-the-box implementations
for [check](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment\_method/check.rb)
and [store credit](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment\_method/store\_credit.rb)
payment methods, and a base implementation
for [credit card](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment\_method/credit\_card.rb)
payment methods.

:::

Payment methods represent different ways customers can pay in your store. For example, you may have
different payment methods for PayPal and Stripe.

Different payment methods support different features, depending on the underlying PSP:

* **Payment sources.** Some payment methods, like check payments or bank transfers, don't need a
  payment source to "draw" money from, e.g. because the payment is done off-site.
* **Payment profiles.** Some payment methods support vaulting, i.e., the ability to store a payment
  source so that it can be charged later. When that's the case, Solidus will attempt to vault the
  payment source after creating a payment for it.

:::info

Not all payment methods are tied to a PSP. For example, the check and store credit payment methods
that Solidus ships with don't need to interact with a PSP to process payments. You can think of
these as "virtual" payment methods.

:::

Solidus doesn't know much about payment gateways as such: instead, payment gateways are just "helper
classes." When processing payments and refunds, Solidus interacts with the payment method, not the
payment gatewayâ€”the payment method can then delegate the calls to the payment gateway with no
modifications ([which is the default](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment\_method.rb#L40))
, or provide its own implementation that wraps the payment gateway's behavior and enriches it with
additional logic.

This abstraction provides several advantages:

* It allows you to encapsulate the API interaction logic for your PSP and test it in isolation,
  whereas the payment method's implementation can deal with Solidus-specific details.
* It allows you to easily implement payment methods that don't use a PSP (e.g. cash on delivery),
  without Solidus having to know about this nuance.
* It allows you to use the store's configuration to determine how to structure the API calls to the
  PSP, and to enrich the API payload with store-specific information (e.g., to add your store's name
  to your customer's credit card statement).

### Payments

The [`Spree::Payment`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment.rb)
model act as a connector between user input and the rest of the payment system. Payments are
associated to an order, a payment source and a payment method.

Payments have
a [state machine](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/lib/spree/core/state\_machines/payment.rb)
that tracks the status of the payment as it goes through the regular payment processing flow.
Through
the [`Spree::Payment::Processing`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment/processing.rb)
module, payments expose a simplified API that protects the rest of the system from PSP connection
errors and data integrity issues, and integrates PSP operations with the payments state machine.

### Refunds

Refunds are a critical part of an eCommerce business and they are issued on a regular basis to
customers for a variety of reasons.

In Solidus, refunds are represented by
the [`Spree::Refund`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/refund.rb)
model, and they are associated to their respective payment. Modeling refunds as a separate concept
from payments makes them very flexible and allows to use them for a broad range of use cases.

Refunds have a very simple API and they only expose
a [`#perform!`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/refund.rb#L42)
method.

## Flow walkthroughs

### Payment processing

:::caution

Payment processing is tightly coupled to the payments state machine API. If you customize or replace
the payments state machine, you will need to make sure that your customizations play well with the
payment processing flow!

:::

The flow for payment processing, in a standard Solidus store, is the following:

* A payment is created, either by the customer or by a store admin.
* Before the order is
  completed, [`process_payments_before_complete`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/order.rb#L726)
  method is called on the order. This
  calls [`process_payments!`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/order/payments.rb#L22)
  which, in turn,
  calls [`process!`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment/processing.rb#L25)
  on all unprocessed payments.
* Depending on whether the payment method uses auto-capture, `process!` either authorizes or
  authorizes and captures the payment.
*

The [`authorize!`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment/processing.rb#L37)
or [`purchase!`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment/processing.rb#L42)
call performs
the [corresponding action on the payment method](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment/processing.rb#L176)
and [updates the payment's state](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment/processing.rb#L185)
accordingly.

At this point, all payments on the order have been processed and they're either authorized or
captured. If they're just authorized, an admin will need to capture the payment manually at a later
stage (e.g., when the order is shipped), which will call
the [`capture!`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment/processing.rb#L49)
method.

### Payment cancellation

:::info

The [`Spree::Payment::Cancellation`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment/cancellation.rb)
class is responsible for cancelling payments in a stock Solidus installation, but you can easily
replace it with your own.

:::

If an order is cancelled at any point, Solidus will also "cancel" any payments on the order. The
flow for payment cancellation is quite straightforward:

1. When an order is cancelled,
   the [state machine](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/lib/spree/core/state\_machines/order.rb#L124)
   calls
   the [`#after_cancel`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/order.rb#L800)
   method on the order.
2. `#after_cancel` loops through all payments, discards the ones that have been fully refunded or
   are not in a cancellable state, and
   calls [`#cancel!`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment/processing.rb#L87)
   on the remaining ones.
3. `#cancel!` [instantiates and run a payment canceller](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment/processing.rb#L87)
   for the payment.
4.

The [default payment canceller](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/payment/cancellation.rb)
has different logic depending on the state of the payment:

1. If the payment has been captured, it refunds the customer (
   see [Refund processing](payments-and-refunds.mdx#refund-processing)).
2. If the payment has only been authorized, it voids the authorization.

### Refund processing

In a stock Solidus store, refunds and they can be created in different ways:

* manually via the admin UI;
* automatically, when [cancelling a payment](payments-and-refunds.mdx#payment-cancellation);
* automatically, when processing a reimbursement.

Some stores also have other ways for a refund to be created, e.g. through a return flow that can be
initiated by the customer via the storefront or a third-party tool.

When a refund is created through the UI, via a payment cancellation or a reimbursement, Solidus will
also immediately call `#perform!` on the refund. This processes the refund through the original
payment's payment method and updates the payment and order accordingly.
