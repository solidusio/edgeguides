# Tax calculation

:::caution
In the following paragraphs, we use the terms **tax calculator** and **rate calculator**. While they sound similar,
they are different things: the taxation system in Solidus primarily relies on tax calculators, not rate calculators.

While
the [default tax calculators](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/tax\_calculator)
delegate the actual taxation math to rate calculators, it's perfectly possible to write a custom tax
calculator that doesn't use rate calculators and instead relies on its own logic, e.g. by querying
an external API.

:::

Solidus's taxation system revolves around the concept of **tax calculators**. These are classes that
implement the logic required for calculating taxes
on [orders](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/tax\_calculator/default.rb)
and [shipping rates](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/tax\_calculator/shipping\_rate.rb).

The default tax calculators rely on **tax categories,** **tax rates** and **rate calculators**.
These are concepts that help configure item taxation through the Solidus backend:

* [**Tax categories**](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/tax\_category.rb)
  are used to group tax rates togetherâ€”all products and shipping methods are assigned a tax
  category.
* [**Tax rates**](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/tax\_rate.rb)
  associate a tax category with a geographic zone and a rate calculator (and also determine whether
  the tax is included in the item's original amount or not).
* [**Rate calculators**](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/calculator/default\_tax.rb)
  implement the actual math for converting a tax rate (e.g., 3% included in price) into a final
  amount (e.g., $3.00, when computed on a $100.00 amount).

This system is very flexible and allows you to insert your custom logic at different abstraction
levels. But before we dive into how to customize it, let's take a look at the flow Solidus follows
for calculating taxes on orders and shipping rates.

## Order taxation

:::info
Note that promotions are applied to orders before taxes are calculated. This is to comply with tax
regulations for value-added taxation [as outlined by the Government of the United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/vat-businesses/discounts-and-free-gifts#1)
and for sales
tax [as outlined by the California State Board of Equalization](http://www.boe.ca.gov/formspubs/pub113/).
:::

The flow for order taxation is the following:

1. Whenever an order is updated, Solidus calls the `OrderUpdater` service. This service is
   responsible for recalculating all the amounts on the order, including tax amounts. This is done
   in the [`update_taxes` method](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/order\_updater.rb#L219),
   which in turn calls the configured order adjuster.
2. The [default order adjuster](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/tax/order\_adjuster.rb)
   uses the configured order tax calculator to [determine](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/tax/order\_adjuster.rb#L17)
   which taxes should be applied to the order, then builds an `OrderTaxation` object and uses it to
   [apply them](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/tax/order\_adjuster.rb#L18).
3. The [`Spree::OrderTaxation` class](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/63c937472de529cce99bf3ea8dd9f2a8cbc0e431/core/app/models/spree/order\_taxation.rb#L26)
   applies the taxes on the order by _upserting_ the corresponding adjustments on the taxed items (i.e., line items and shipments).
4. The order's `included_tax_total` or `additional_tax_total`
   are [updated](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/order\_updater.rb#L219)
   according to the adjustments created in the previous step.

## Shipping rate taxation

:::info
For more information on when and how shipments and shipping rates are built, you can refer to
the [Stock management](/reference/stock-management.mdx) guide.
:::

In addition to calculating taxes on orders Solidus also calculates taxes on shipping rates. The flow
here is slightly different, and is kicked off by
the [default stock estimator](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/stock/estimator.rb):

1. Right after building the shipping rate for a shipment,
   Solidus [calls the configured shipping rate tax calculator](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/stock/estimator.rb#L45)
   to calculate the tax for each shipping rate.
2. Shipping rates don't have adjustments, so the resulting taxes are stored in a
   dedicated [`ShippingRateTax`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/shipping\_rate\_tax.rb)
   model instead.

:::caution

Note that, while these tax amounts will be included in the shipping rates that are displayed to your
user, Solidus will still re-calculate taxes on your shipment cost, and the final amount the user is
charged depends on the shipment's cost rather than the shipping rate's cost.

This is because you may have additional adjustments on your shipment, e.g. you're offering a "free
shipping" promotion and want to completely discount shipping for the user. In this case, the
shipping rate might be $10.0 + a $2.0 tax, but your shipment total will still be $0.0.

You should treat tax calculation for shipping rates as a UI-only matter. The standard order tax
calculation flow determines the price your user will pay.
