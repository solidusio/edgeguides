# Stock management

The stock system in Solidus is possibly one of the most complicated and powerful provided by the
platform. It consists of several pieces, all working in unison.

It all begins when an order is about to transition to the `delivery` state. When that happens, the
order state
machine [calls the `create_proposed_shipments`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/lib/spree/core/state\_machines/order.rb#L103)
method on the order, which in turn [uses the configured **stock
coordinator**](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/order.rb#L493)
to re-create the order's shipments.

:::caution

If you remove the `delivery` state from the order state machine, or override the state machine with
your own, the stock coordinator won't be called automatically anymore, and it will be up to you to
call it at the right time.

:::

The **stock coordinator** is the main actor in the stock system and coordinates all the other
components. It takes an order as input and builds a list of proposed shipments for that order, along
with their available shipping rates (e.g., FedEx Home Delivery for $10, FedEx Overnight for $20,
etc.).

The default implementation of the stock coordinator
is [`Spree::Stock::SimpleCoordinator`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/stock/simple\_coordinator.rb)
, but you can use a different coordinator if you want. In the rest of this guide, we'll assume you'
re using the default `SimpleCoordinator` and we'll explain its inner workings.

:::caution

The default `SimpleCoordinator` class contains stock coordination logic that is the result of years
of eCommerce experience and community contributions. We strongly recommend going with the default
implementation and only overriding its subcomponents, unless you _really_ know what you're doing.

The work done by the stock estimator can be split in two logical chunks:

1. First, the estimator **creates the packages** for the
   order. [Packages](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/stock/package.rb)
   are a simplified version of shipments, meant to hold information about which stock is leaving
   from which stock location.
2. It then converts the packages into shipments and **estimates the shipping rates** for those
   shipments, depending on the shipping methods available in the store.

Let's see which other service objects are involved in these two processes!

## Package creation

The following actors are involved in the package creation phase:

* **Stock location filter:** this class is responsible for filtering the stock locations created in
  the backend and only returning the ones that should be used for the current order (e.g., you may
  want to only use stock locations in the customer's country).
* **Stock location sorter:** this class is responsible for sorting the list of filtered stock
  locations in order of priority (e.g., you may want to pick inventory from the stock location
  closest to the customer).
* **Stock allocator:** this class is responsible for allocating stock from the selected stock
  locations (e.g., you may want to allocate on-hand inventory before backordering).
* **Stock splitters:** this class is responsible for splitting the allocated inventory units into
  different packages (e.g., you may want to keep all packages below a certain weight, and ship
  multiple packages if needed).

The process for package creation is fairly straightforward:

1. First, the coordinator uses the **configured stock location** filter to get the list of stock
   locations to use for the current order.
2. Then, the filtered list is sorted with the **configured stock location sorter**.
3. Then, the filtered and sorted stock locations, along with the inventory units to allocate, are
   passed to the **configured stock allocator**, which maps each stock location to a list of on-hand
   inventory units to ship and backorderable inventory units to backorder. (At this point, an "
   insufficient stock" error is raised if there's leftover inventory that couldn't be allocated from
   any stock location.)
4. Then, the list of on-hand and backorderable inventory units is converted into **packages**, one
   package per stock location.
5. Finally, the list of packages is passed to the **configured stock splitters**, which may further
   split up the original packages.

At this point, we have our final list of packages. It's now time to convert them into real shipments
and estimate their shipping rates.

## Rate estimation

The rate estimation process follows a similar pattern:

1. First, the coordinator converts the packages into shipments.
2. Then, it calls the **configured estimator** to calculate the shipping rates for each package.
3. Finally, it links the shipping rates for each package to the corresponding shipment.

Because the estimator is configurable, you can override the estimation logic however you want.

However, for the purpose of this guide, we'll assume you're using the
default [`Spree::Stock::Estimator`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/stock/estimator.rb)
, and we'll explain its process too:

1. First, the estimator retrieves the list of shipping methods available for the package being
   estimated. This determination takes into account the current store, the order's shipping address
   and the currency on the shipping method's calculator.
2. Then, it calculates the rate for each available shipping method, by using the calculator
   configured on the shipping method.
3. Then, it filters out any rates that belong to backend-only shipping methods, in case the
   calculation is being performed from the storefront.
4. Then, it selects the default shipping rate by using the configured **shipping rate selector**.
5. Finally, it sorts the shipping rates by using the configured **shipping rate sorter**.

The result of this process is a sorted list of shipping rates for the original package, with a
default shipping rate already pre-selected for the user.

## Inventory unit creation

When the stock coordinator needs to construct shipments for an order, it needs to generate inventory
units for that shipment. It delegates this task to
the [configured inventory unit builder](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/3ce8dc4bf8fc9b85418cdaff4c53748bb807996c/core/app/models/spree/stock/simple\_coordinator.rb#L27-L28)
. This configurable class is responsible for building (but not saving) the inventory units that make
up the order.
