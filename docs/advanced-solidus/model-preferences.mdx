# Model preferences

## Why are they needed?

We've already
covered [application-wide preferences](../getting-started/installing-solidus.mdx#first-time-configuration).
Model preferences have a different scope, as they apply to a single ActiveRecord model and can take
different values for each instance or record.

You might think that's what regular ActiveRecord attributes are for. However, preferences are handy
when
using [Single Table Inheritance](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Inheritance.html) (
STI), i.e., when different models share the same database table. In those cases, you might need to
add a piece of information only for one of them and avoid creating a new column with a `NULL` value
for inapplicable models.

:::danger

Internally, preferences are handled as
a [serializable ActiveRecord attribute](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/AttributeMethods/Serialization/ClassMethods.html)
. Notice that serialized data is persisted as a raw string in the database engine. That means
they're okay to read information from a loaded record, but they're not suited to perform SQL queries
on a large dataset.

## Preferable models

:::caution

Solidus preferences are the right option when you’re writing code that is tightly coupled to
Solidus (e.g., it's a descendant of a preferable Solidus class, or it will be configurable via the
Solidus admin panel).

If you're writing code that doesn't belong to the Solidus domain (e.g., your own application's
business logic), it's almost always better to forgo preferences and use regular ActiveRecord
attributes instead.

:::

To make a model accept preferences (i.e., to make it "preferable"), you will first need to add
a `preferences` column of type `text` to your model. Assuming you already have a model
named `Greeter`, here's how to do it:

```
$ rails g migration AddPreferencesToGreeter preferences:text
$ rails db:migrate
```

Then, you'll need to include the `Spree::Preferences::Persistable` module in your model:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

require 'spree/preferences/persistable'

module AmazingStore
  class Greeter
    include Spree::Preferences::Persistable
  end
end
```

And there you go! Your model is now preferable. Let's see how to use it.

## Adding new preferences

Adding a new preference is as simple as calling the `preference` method in your class:

```diff
# frozen_string_literal: true

require 'spree/preferences/persistable'

module AmazingStore
  class Greeter
    include Spree::Preferences::Persistable

+   preference :name, :string, default: "John"
  end
end
```

That's it! As you can see, you can also specify a default value with the `:default` option.

:::info

Besides `:string`, other types can be used for a preference.
See [`Spree::Preferences::Preferable`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/master/core/lib/spree/preferences/preferable.rb)
for details.

:::

## Accessing preferences

A few magic methods are generated for each preference in a model instance. For example, given
a `:category` preference, the following methods will be generated:

* `#preferred_category`: reader for the preference value.
* `#preferred_category=(value)`: writer for the preference value (no persistence).
* `#preferred_category_default`: default for the preference.
* `#preferred_category_type`: type for the default preference.

```ruby
calculator = MyStore::NewTaxCalculator
calculator.preferred_category = "B"
calculator.preferred_category # => "B"
calculator.preferred_category_default # => "A"
calculator.preferred_category_type # => :string
```

Solidus also provides some generic methods:

* `#get_preference(name)`: Returns the value for the given preference.
* `#set_preference(name, value)`: Sets the value for the given preference (no persistence).
* `#preference_default(name)`: Gets the default for the given preference.
* `#preference_type(name)`: Gets the type for the given preference.
* `#has_preference?(name)`: Predicate to check whether a preference is defined.

```ruby
calculator.set_preference(:category, "B")
calculator.get_preference(:category) # => "B"
calculator.preference_default(:category) # => "A"
calculator.preference_type(:category) # => :string
calculator.has_preference?(:category) # => true
calculator.has_preference?(:other) # => false
```

Finally, some methods allow inspecting the entire collection of preferences:

* `#preferences`: Hash of preferences.
* `#default_preferences`: Hash of default preferences.

```ruby
calculator.preferences # => { :category=>"B" }
calculator.default_preferences # => { :category=>"A" }
```

To bring it all together, let's use our `name` preference in the `Greeter` model to do something:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

require 'spree/preferences/persistable'

module AmazingStore
  class Greeter
    include Spree::Preferences::Persistable

    preference :name, :string, default: "John"

    def call
      "Hello, #{name}!"
    end
  end
end
```

Let's test it:

```ruby
AmazingStore::Greeter.new.call # => "Hello, John!"
AmazingStore::Greeter.new(preferred_name: "Jane").call # => "Hello, Jane!"
```

Neat!

## Static preferences

Sometimes, you might not want to store preferences in your database. This is the case, for example,
with API credentials or other sensitive information. [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)
recommends storing this data in an environment variable.

Solidus supports this mechanism, which is called "static preferences", out of the box.Let's
repurpose our `Greeter` model to use them!

First of all, we need to add a `preference_source` column (we'll see why in a second):

```
$ rails g migration AddPreferenceSourceToGreeter preference_source
$ rails db:migrate
```

Then, we need to include the `Spree::Preferences::StaticallyConfigurable` module:

```diff
# frozen_string_literal: true

require 'spree/preferences/persistable'
+ require 'spree/preferences/statically_configurable'

module AmazingStore
  class Greeter
    include Spree::Preferences::Persistable
+   include Spree::Preferences::StaticallyConfigurable

    preference :name, :string
  end
end
```

Finally, we'll need to configure one or more preference sources, i.e. the actual collection of
preference values that can be used for instances of our `AmazingStore::Greeter` model.

This can be done in any initializer, including `config/initializers/spree.rb`:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  Spree::Config.static_model_preferences.add(
    AmazingStore::Greeter,
    'greeter_preferences',
    name: ENV["GREETER_NAME"],
  )
end
```

Let's test it again!

```ruby
ENV["GREETER_NAME"] = "Jane" # To simulate an environment variable

AmazingStore::Greeter.new(
  preference_source: "greeter_preferences",
).call # => "Hello, Jane!"
```

In our example, we are using environment variables to provide the preference values, but you can use
a secret store such as [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) or anything else!

## Built-in preferable models

Solidus comes with a few preferable models out of the box,
like [`Spree::PaymentMethod`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/master/core/app/models/spree/payment\_method.rb)
and [`Spree::Calculator`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/master/core/app/models/spree/calculator.rb)
. In most cases, you will just inherit from these classes, which means you won't need any of the
boilerplate setup code. Instead, you will just add new preferences to your custom descendant.

Let's see a couple of examples!

### Calculators

Say that you want to create a [calculator](tax-calculation.mdx#customizing-tax-calculation) for a new
tax whose amount depends on a categorization of some type. Calculators
are [already configurable](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/master/core/app/models/spree/calculator.rb#L7)
, so you can create a new class that inherits from `Spree::Calculator` and add a `category`
preference to it:

```ruby title="app/models/amazing_store/new_tax_calculator.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

module AmazingStore
  class NewTaxCalculator < Spree::Calculator
    preference :category, :string, default: "A"

    AMOUNT_PER_CATEGORY = {
      "A" => 10,
      "B" => 20,
      "C" => 30
    }

    def initialize(order)
      @order = order
    end

    def calculate
      Spree::Tax::OrderTax.new(
        order_id: order.id,
        line_item_taxes: order.amount + AMOUNT_PER_CATEGORY[preferred_category],
        shipment_taxes: 0
      )
    end
  end
end
```

:::info

You'll notice we don't have to include any files or module in our payment method. That's
because `Spree::PaymentMethod` [already does it for us!](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/master/core/app/models/spree/payment\_method.rb#L15)

:::

That's it! You can now use your `AmazingStore::NewTaxCalculator`.

### Payment methods

Payment methods are another example of a configurable class in Solidus. Furthermore, they're
statically configurable, so that you can store your payment provider credentials outside of the DB.

Say, for example, that you've followed the guide
to [create a new payment method](payments-and-refunds.mdx#building-a-custom-payment-source), and all
that's left to do is to add a configurable API key to your custom payment method. You can do it like
this:

```ruby title="app/models/amazing_store/amazing_payment_method.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

module AmazingStore
  class AmazingPaymentMethod < Spree::PaymentMethod
    preference :api_key, :string
  end
end
```

As you see, we've added an `api_key` preference for it, but we don't want its value to be rendered
in plain sight in the backend, and we don't want it to be stored in the database. Let's, therefore,
add a source from where the new payment method can read its preferences:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
# ...
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  Spree::Config.static_model_preferences.add(
    AmazingStore::AmazingPaymentMethod,
    'amazing_payment_method_credentials',
    api_key: ENV['AMAZING_PAYMENT_METHOD_API_KEY'],
    server: Rails.env.production? ? 'production' : 'test',
    test_mode: !Rails.env.production?
  )
end
```

:::info

If you're wondering where those `server` and `test_mode` settings come from, they're common
preferences inherited from [`Spree::PaymentMethod`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/master/core/app/models/spree/payment\_method.rb).

:::

You can now to _Settings -> Payments -> New Payment Method_, create a new instance of
your `AmazingPaymentMethod`, and pick `amazing_payment_method_credentials` as the preference source
to read the API key from the environment!
