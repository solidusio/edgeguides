# Stock management

## Architecture overview

The stock system in Solidus is possibly one of the most complicated and powerful provided by the
platform. It consists of several pieces, all working in unison.

It all begins when an order is about to transition to the `delivery` state. When that happens, the
order state
machine [calls the `create_proposed_shipments`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/lib/spree/core/state\_machines/order.rb#L103)
method on the order, which in turn [uses the configured **stock
coordinator**](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/order.rb#L493)
to re-create the order's shipments.

:::caution

If you remove the `delivery` state from the order state machine, or override the state machine with
your own, the stock coordinator won't be called automatically anymore, and it will be up to you to
call it at the right time.

:::

The **stock coordinator** is the main actor in the stock system and coordinates all the other
components. It takes an order as input and builds a list of proposed shipments for that order, along
with their available shipping rates (e.g., FedEx Home Delivery for $10, FedEx Overnight for $20,
etc.).

The default implementation of the stock coordinator
is [`Spree::Stock::SimpleCoordinator`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/stock/simple\_coordinator.rb)
, but you can use a different coordinator if you want. In the rest of this guide, we'll assume you'
re using the default `SimpleCoordinator` and we'll explain its inner workings.

:::caution

The default `SimpleCoordinator` class contains stock coordination logic that is the result of years
of eCommerce experience and community contributions. We strongly recommend going with the default
implementation and only overriding its subcomponents, unless you _really_ know what you're doing.

:::

The work done by the stock estimator can be split in two logical chunks:

1. First, the estimator **creates the packages** for the
   order. [Packages](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/stock/package.rb)
   are a simplified version of shipments, meant to hold information about which stock is leaving
   from which stock location.
2. It then converts the packages into shipments and **estimates the shipping rates** for those
   shipments, depending on the shipping methods available in the store.

Let's see which other service objects are involved in these two processes!

### Package creation

The following actors are involved in the package creation phase:

* **Stock location filter:** this class is responsible for filtering the stock locations created in
  the backend and only returning the ones that should be used for the current order (e.g., you may
  want to only use stock locations in the customer's country).
* **Stock location sorter:** this class is responsible for sorting the list of filtered stock
  locations in order of priority (e.g., you may want to pick inventory from the stock location
  closest to the customer).
* **Stock allocator:** this class is responsible for allocating stock from the selected stock
  locations (e.g., you may want to allocate on-hand inventory before backordering).
* **Stock splitters:** this class is responsible for splitting the allocated inventory units into
  different packages (e.g., you may want to keep all packages below a certain weight, and ship
  multiple packages if needed).

The process for package creation is fairly straightforward:

1. First, the coordinator uses the **configured stock location** filter to get the list of stock
   locations to use for the current order.
2. Then, the filtered list is sorted with the **configured stock location sorter**.
3. Then, the filtered and sorted stock locations, along with the inventory units to allocate, are
   passed to the **configured stock allocator**, which maps each stock location to a list of on-hand
   inventory units to ship and backorderable inventory units to backorder. (At this point, an "
   insufficient stock" error is raised if there's leftover inventory that couldn't be allocated from
   any stock location.)
4. Then, the list of on-hand and backorderable inventory units is converted into **packages**, one
   package per stock location.
5. Finally, the list of packages is passed to the **configured stock splitters**, which may further
   split up the original packages.

At this point, we have our final list of packages. It's now time to convert them into real shipments
and estimate their shipping rates.

### Rate estimation

The rate estimation process follows a similar pattern:

1. First, the coordinator converts the packages into shipments.
2. Then, it calls the **configured estimator** to calculate the shipping rates for each package.
3. Finally, it links the shipping rates for each package to the corresponding shipment.

Because the estimator is configurable, you can override the estimation logic however you want.

However, for the purpose of this guide, we'll assume you're using the
default [`Spree::Stock::Estimator`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/stock/estimator.rb)
, and we'll explain its process too:

1. First, the estimator retrieves the list of shipping methods available for the package being
   estimated. This determination takes into account the current store, the order's shipping address
   and the currency on the shipping method's calculator.
2. Then, it calculates the rate for each available shipping method, by using the calculator
   configured on the shipping method.
3. Then, it filters out any rates that belong to backend-only shipping methods, in case the
   calculation is being performed from the storefront.
4. Then, it selects the default shipping rate by using the configured **shipping rate selector**.
5. Finally, it sorts the shipping rates by using the configured **shipping rate sorter**.

The result of this process is a sorted list of shipping rates for the original package, with a
default shipping rate already pre-selected for the user.

### Inventory unit creation

When the stock coordinator needs to construct shipments for an order, it needs to generate inventory
units for that shipment. It delegates this task to
the [configured inventory unit builder](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/3ce8dc4bf8fc9b85418cdaff4c53748bb807996c/core/app/models/spree/stock/simple\_coordinator.rb#L27-L28)
. This configurable class is responsible for building (but not saving) the inventory units that make
up the order.

## Customizing package creation

There are several pieces you can customize in the package creation process:

* the **stock location filter,** to customize which stock locations Solidus picks inventory from;
* the **location sorter,** to customize how Solidus prioritizes stock locations to pick inventory
  from;
* the **allocator,** to customize how Solidus prioritizes inventory units to allocate from the
  filtered and sorted stock locations;
* the **splitters,** to customize how Solidus splits the allocated inventory units in packages.

In the next paragraphs, we'll see a brief example for each of these customizations!

### Stock location filter

:::info

The [default stock location filter](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/6c0da5d618a6d04d13ef50ec01ae17c3b06f6259/core/app/models/spree/stock/location\_filter/active.rb)
simply filters out the inactive stock locations.

:::

Let's say you are a giant brand with warehouses all over the US, and you only ever want to ship from
the stock locations in the customer's state.

You can do that by writing a custom stock location filter that looks like this:

```ruby title="app/models/awesome:store/stock/location:filter/order:state.rb"
module AwesomeStore
  module Stock
    module LocationFilter
      class OrderState < Spree::Stock::LocationFilter::Base
        def filter
          stock_locations.active.where(state: order.ship_address.state)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

As you can see, the logic is pretty simple: we take an initial list of stock locations (the default
stock coordinator will simply pass all stock locations here) and then we only pick the ones that are
active and where the state matches the state on the order's shipping address.

In order to start using our new stock location filter, you just need to configure it:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.stock.location_filter_class = 'AwesomeStore::Stock::LocationFilter::OrderState'
end
```

### Stock location sorter

:::info

[By default,](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/6c0da5d618a6d04d13ef50ec01ae17c3b06f6259/core/app/models/spree/stock/location\_sorter/unsorted.rb)
stock locations are unsorted, but Solidus provides a
built-in [`DefaultFirst`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/6c0da5d618a6d04d13ef50ec01ae17c3b06f6259/core/app/models/spree/stock/location\_sorter/default\_first.rb)
sorter that will put the default stock location first.

:::

Let's say that you ship from a mix of your own warehouses and third-party warehouses, and you want
to ship from your own warehouses first in order to minimize fulfillment cost.

You could do this with a custom stock location sorter:

```ruby title="app/models/awesome:store/stock/location:sorter/self:owned:first.rb"
module AwesomeStore
  module Stock
    module LocationSorter
      class SelfOwnedFirst < Spree::Stock::LocationSorter::Base
        def sort
          # We're assuming the `self_owned` column is `true` when the warehouse
          # is self-owned, and `false` when it's ownerd by a third-party.
          stock_locations.order(self_owned: :desc)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The implementation is pretty similar to that of the stock location filter: you take an initial list
of sorted stock locations and you return a sorted list.

Now that you have implemented your sorter, you need to enable it:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.stock.location_sorter_class = 'AwesomeStore::Stock::LocationSorter::SelfOwnedFirst'
end
```

### Stock allocator

:::info

The [default stock allocator](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/6c0da5d618a6d04d13ef50ec01ae17c3b06f6259/core/app/models/spree/stock/allocator/on\_hand\_first.rb)
picks on hand inventory units before backordered inventory units.

:::

Let's say you're a drop-shipping business, but you also hold a tiny amount of inventory on-hand for
VIP customers or other special cases. In this case, you want to make sure you backorder all items
and never touch your on-hand inventory unless absolutely needed (e.g.., if the customer ordered an
item that's not being produced anymore and cannot be backordered).

You could accomplish this with a custom stock allocator such as the following:

```ruby title="app/models/awesome:store/stock/allocator/backordered:first.rb"
module AwesomeStore
  module Stock
    module Allocator
      class BackorderedFirst < Spree::Stock::Allocator::Base
        def allocate_inventory(desired)
          # Allocate backordered inventory first
          backordered = allocate_backordered(desired)
          desired -= backordered.values.sum if backordered.present?

          # Allocate any non-backorderable inventory from on-hand inventory
          on_hand = allocate_on_hand(desired)
          desired -= on_hand.values.sum if on_hand.present?

          # `desired` at this point should be empty if we managed to
          # allocate all required inventory
          [on_hand, backordered, desired]
        end

        protected

        # In these two methods, `availability` is a `Spree::Stock::Availability`
        # instance, which maps a list of variants to their availability in the
        # filtered stock locations

        def allocate_backordered(desired)
          allocate(availability.backorderable_by_stock_location_id, desired)
        end

        def allocate_on_hand(desired)
          allocate(availability.on_hand_by_stock_location_id, desired)
        end

        def allocate(availability_by_location, desired)
          # `availability_by_location` is a `Spree::StockQuantities` instance
          # that makes it easier to perform operations on inventory units
          availability_by_location.transform_values do |available|
            # Find the desired inventory which is available at this location
            packaged = available & desired
            # Remove found inventory from desired
            desired -= packaged
            packaged
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This allocator is extremely similar to Solidus' default stock allocator, but it works backwards: it
allocates backordered inventory units before starting to pick on-hand inventory units.

:::info

Because operations on inventory units can be a bit complicated for a developer to perform manually,
Solidus provides two helper
classes, [`Spree::Stock::Availability`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/6c0da5d618a6d04d13ef50ec01ae17c3b06f6259/core/app/models/spree/stock/availability.rb)
and [`Spree::StockQuantities`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/6c0da5d618a6d04d13ef50ec01ae17c3b06f6259/core/app/models/spree/stock\_quantities.rb)
, which make it easier to reason about and perform algebraic operations on inventory units. Feel
free to take a look at their source code to understand how they work in detail.

:::

### Stock splitters

:::info

The default splitter chain will split packages
by [shipping category](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/6c0da5d618a6d04d13ef50ec01ae17c3b06f6259/core/app/models/spree/stock/splitter/shipping\_category.rb)
and then
by [availability](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/6c0da5d618a6d04d13ef50ec01ae17c3b06f6259/core/app/models/spree/stock/splitter/backordered.rb) (
i.e., by separating on hand and backordered items in different packages).

There's also a `Weight` splitter that is not enabled by default, which will split packages so that
they are all below a certain weight threshold.

:::

An important aspect to understand about stock splitters is that, unlike all the other components of
the stock system, you can have multiple stock splitters configured at the same time to form a **
splitter chain**.

When the packages are ready to be split, Solidus will pass the initial list of packages to the first
splitter in the chain, and each splitter is responsible for running its logic and passing the result
to the next splitter in the chain, until the end of the chain is reached.

As an example, let's say you ship some frozen products that are packaged in dry ice. You want to
split frozen products and regular products in separate packages.

You could accomplish this with a custom stock splitter such as the following:

```ruby
module AwesomeStore
  module Stock
    module Splitter
      class FrozenItems < Spree::Stock::Splitter::Base
        def split(packages)
          split_packages = []

          packages.each do |package|
            # Split each package in frozen and non-frozen items
            split_packages += split_package(package)
          end

          # `return_next` is a helper that will pass the split
          # packages to the next splitter in the chain
          return_next split_packages
        end

        private

        def split_package(package)
          frozen_items = []
          non_frozen_items = []

          package.contents.each do |item|
            # We are assuming that `Spree::Variant` responds to `#frozen?`
            if item.variant.frozen?
              frozen_items << item
            else
              non_frozen_items << item
            end
          end

          # The `build_package` method is a helper that takes a
          # list of items and builds a package with them.
          [
            # Build the package for frozen items
            build_package(frozen_items),
            # Build the package for non-frozen items
            build_package(non_frozen_items),
          ]
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The implementation here is slightly more complicated than usual, so let's walk through it:

1. First, we loop through each package that is passed to the splitter.
2. Then, for each package, we separate the frozen and the non-frozen items in two separate packages.
3. Then, we pass the final list of split packages to the next stock location splitter.

:::caution

As you may imagine, the order of stock splitters is important to determine the final result of the
splitter chain. When you implement a custom stock splitter, make sure to add it in the right place!
If you want full control over the splitter chain, you can override the `stock_splitters` array
completely rather than appending to it.

:::

Now that we have our new splitter, we need to add it to the splitter chain:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.environment.stock_splitters << 'AwesomeStore::Stock::Splitter::FrozenItems'
end
```

## Customizing rate estimation

As far as the rate estimation is concerned, there are two pieces you can customize:

* the **estimator,** to customize how Solidus calculates shipping rates for a shipment;
* the **shipping rate selector**, to customize how Solidus selects a default shipping rate;
* the **shipping rate sorter**, to customize how Solidus sorts shipping rates.

In the next paragraphs, we'll see a brief example for each of these customizations!

### **Shipping rate estimator**

:::info

The [default shipping rate estimator](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/6c0da5d618a6d04d13ef50ec01ae17c3b06f6259/core/app/models/spree/stock/estimator.rb)
simply uses the shipping methods you have configured on your store, along with the respective
calculators, to calculate the right shipping rate for each shipment/shipping method combination.

:::

For large/complex stores, using fixed shipping rates, or attempting to re-create the shipping rate
calculation logic used by carriers, is simply not feasible. When that's the case, you can override
Solidus' shipping rate estimator to bypass the configured shipping methods completely and use an
external data source such as an API (e.g., [EasyPost](https://www.easypost.com/)).

Let's see an example with EasyPost:

```ruby
module AwesomeStore
  module Stock
    class EasypostEstimator
      def shipping_rates(package, _frontend_only = true)
        # Create a new shipment with the EasyPost API and
        easypost_rates = get_rates_from_easypost(package)

        # Retrieve the rates for the EasyPost shipment
        shipping_rates = easypost_rates.map do |easypost_rate|
          # Turn the EasyPost rate into a Solidus shipping rate
          build_shipping_rate(easypost_rate)
        end

        # Choose the default shipping rate through the configured shipping rate selector
        unless shipping_rates.empty?
          default_shipping_rate = Spree::Config.shipping_rate_selector_class.new(shipping_rates).find_default
          default_shipping_rate.selected = true
        end

        # Sort the shipping rates through the configured shipping rate sorter
        Spree::Config.shipping_rate_sorter_class.new(shipping_rates).sort
      end

      private

      def get_rates_from_easypost(package)
        # API integration logic here...
      end

      def build_shipping_rate(easypost_rate)
        # Find or create a new shipping method in Solidus
        # for this EasyPost rate
        shipping_method = Spree::ShippingMethod.find_or_create_by(
          carrier: easypost_rate.carrier,
          service_level: easypost_rate.service,
        ) do |shipping_method|
          shipping_method.name = "#{easypost_rate.carrier} #{easypost_rate.service}"
          shipping_method.calculator = Spree::Calculator::Shipping::FlatRate.create
          shipping_method.shipping_categories = Spree::ShippingCategory.all
          shipping_method.available_to_users = true
        end

        # Build a Solidus shipping rate for this EasyPost rate
        Spree::ShippingRate.new(
          shipping_method: shipping_method,
          name: "#{easypost_rate.carrier} #{easypost_rate.service}",
          cost: easypost_rate.rate,
        )
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The API integration logic has been left out on purpose, so let's walk through the rest of the
implementation:

1. First, we call the EasyPost API to create a shipment and retrieve the proposed rates.
2. Then, we transform the EasyPost rates into `Spree::ShippingRate` instances.
3. Then, we choose the default rate through the configured shipping rate selector.
4. Then, we sort the rates through the configured shipping rate sorter.
5. Finally, we return the sorted rates.

:::info

Notice how, in the `build_shipping_rate` method, we are finding or creating the shipping method for
each EasyPost rate, since we're not relying on the shipping methods stored in the DB but reading
them directly from EasyPost. An alternative would be to only generate EasyPost rates for shipping
methods that already exist in the Solidus DB (e.g., to give admins more granular control over which
shipping methods to enable).

:::

Now that our estimator is ready, we just need to configure it:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.stock.estimator_class = 'AwesomeStore::Stock::EasypostEstimator'
end
```

### Shipping rate selector

:::info

The [default shipping rate selector](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/6c0da5d618a6d04d13ef50ec01ae17c3b06f6259/core/app/models/spree/stock/shipping\_rate\_selector.rb)
pre-selects the lowest-priced shipping rate for the user.

:::

What if we wanted to pre-select the shipping rate with the quickest delivery time? We could easily
accomplish this through a custom shipping rate selector:

```ruby
module AwesomeStore
  module Stock
    class ShippingRateSelector
      attr_reader :shipping_rates

      def initialize(shipping_rates)
        @shipping_rates = shipping_rates
      end

      def find_default
        # This assumes `Spree::ShippingRate` responds to `#delivery_time`
        # with the number of days it will take to deliver the package
        shipping_rates.min_by(&:delivery_time)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The logic here is extremely simple: we accept a list of shipping rates as input, and we simply
return the shipping rate that needs to be selected as the default, by looking for the shipping rate
with the lowest delivery time.

As usual, we now need to tell Solidus to use our shipping rate selector:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.stock.shipping_rate_selector_class = 'AwesomeStore::Stock::ShippingRateSelector'
end
```

### Shipping rate sorter

:::info

The [default shipping rate sorter](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/6c0da5d618a6d04d13ef50ec01ae17c3b06f6259/core/app/models/spree/stock/shipping\_rate\_sorter.rb)
sorts the shipping rates by price, from lowest to highest.

:::

Let's say we also want to sort the shipping rates by delivery time, so that the customer can more
easily make an informed decision.

All we need to do is create a custom shipping rate sorter:

```ruby
module AwesomeStore
  module Stock
    class ShippingRateSorter
      attr_reader :shipping_rates

      def initialize(shipping_rates)
        @shipping_rates = shipping_rates
      end

      def sort
        # This assumes `Spree::ShippingRate` responds to `#delivery_time`
        # with the number of days it will take to deliver the package
        shipping_rates.sort_by(&:delivery_time)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

As you can see, shipping rate sorters are very simple: they accept a list of shipping rates and
return it sorted. In our case, we are sorting the shipping rates by a custom `delivery_time`
attribute.

Then, we just tell Solidus to use our custom shipping rate sorter:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.stock.shipping_rate_sorter_class = 'AwesomeStore::Stock::ShippingRateSorter'
end
```

## Customizing inventory unit creation

Some stores may need to customize inventory unit creation. This is the case when stores have line
items that don't map normally to the actual fulfilled items. For example, you might sell a "bundle"
product that needs to be expanded into the composite items of the bundle in the shipment.

There are three important classes that need to be overridden to accomplish customizations around
this: the inventory unit builder, the availability validator, and the inventory validator.

### Inventory unit builder

The inventory unit builder is the class responsible for actually looping over the line items in the
order and constructing the inventory units from them. This class is where you would implement your
logic that transforms your "bundle" line items into their composite parts.

You would implement your custom builder:

```ruby
module AwesomeStore
  module Stock
    class InventoryUnitBuilder
      def initialize(order)
        @order = order
      end

      # This method must return unsaved inventory units for all items in
      # the given order.
      def units
        @order.line_items.flat_map do |line_item|
          # Put your custom logic here.
        end
      end

      # This method must return unsaved inventory units that that should
      # exist for this line item, but currently do not
      def missing_units_for_line_item(line_item)
        # Put your custom logic here.
      end
    end
  end
end

```

Then, you would tell Solidus to use it:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.stock.inventory_unit_builder_class = 'AwesomeStore::Stock::InventoryUnitBuilder'
end
```

### Availability validator

The availability validator is responsible for validating that there is inventory available for a
given line item. If you're customizing the mapping of line items to inventory units, you'll need to
reflect your new behaviour here.

You can implement a custom availability validator:

```ruby
module AwesomeStore
  module Stock
    class AvailabilityValidator < ActiveModel::Validator
      def validate(line_item)
        # This method takes a line item and returns a boolean indicating whether
        # inventory is available for it. It also needs to attach a validation
        # error to the quantity field of the line item.
      end
    end
  end
end
```

With the custom class in place, you can then tell Solidus to use it:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.stock.availability_validator_class = 'AwesomeStore::Stock::AvailabilityValidator'
end
```

### Inventory validator

The final class you'll need to customize to handle inventory unit creation customizations is the
inventory validator. It is responsible for validating that the inventory units associated with a
line item match what the line item requires as part of the checkout process.

By default, this class simply checks that the number of inventory units matches the quantity of the
line item.

You can define a custom inventory validator:

```ruby
module AwesomeStore
  module Stock
    class InventoryValidator < ActiveModel::Validator
      def validate(line_item)
        # If the line item's inventory units do not match up with what it requires
        # then this method should attach an error to the :inventory field of the
        # line item and return that error.
        #
        # The stock logic looks like this:
        if line_item.inventory_units.count != line_item.quantity
          line_item.errors.add(:inventory, I18n.t(
            'spree.inventory_not_available',
            item: line_item.variant.name
          ))
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

With your custom inventory validator defined, you can tell Solidus to use it:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.stock.inventory_validator_class = 'AwesomeStore::Stock::InventoryValidator'
end
```
