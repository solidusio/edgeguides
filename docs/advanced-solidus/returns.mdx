# Returns

This guide will go through what Solidus offers to manage the return of
purchased items: the compensation of their cost in different ways or the
exchange with other products.

Sometimes things don't go as expected during an online transaction. Items can
get damaged in their way, or the wrong product is shipped by error. Other
times, companies have flexible return policies to remove friction in the
payment step. In any case, e-commerce stores need a process to monitor returns
and reliably support customers and administrators.

## RMA: return authorizations

The journey of a return usually begins with the buyer asking for it, whether
via form or email. At that moment, the customer service can create an RMA
(Return Merchandise Authorization) with a unique number that can be used as a
reference for any further communication.

In Solidus, an RMA is represented by the
[`Spree::ReturnAuthorization`][return-authorization] model. It contains a
number and other information like the stock location where items should be
delivered or a memo for a free-text description.

A `Spree::ReturnAuthorization` has an authorized state on creation, but it can
be canceled if desired. We must note that, at this point, we're still dealing
with user requests, not actual returns. A store can authorize a request and
keep processing it, regardless of its final result (e.g., not ending up
accepting a return), or it can cancel it for being invalid and not deserving
further consideration.

## Return items

An RMA must reference one or more of the products a customer purchased. For
instance, a user bought five cups, but one of them arrived damaged. Depending
on the store policy, they might ask for a reimbursement or an exchange for
another cup. At a later stage, the request will be approved, edited or denied.

In Solidus, each return item is represented through a
[`Spree::ReturnItem`][return-item] record. Notice that a `Spree::ReturnItem`
instance is associated with a [`Spree::InventoryUnit`][inventory-unit]. That's
the most concrete level of product identification in orders; i.e., orders can
have several line items for different variants, and each line item may contain
one or more. The inventory unit maps one to one to a physical (or digital, for
what it's worth) object, such as a broken cup.

A `Spree::ReturnItem` contains information about the requested reimbursement
amount and how it should be processed (e.g., refund or store credit) or another
unit with which the store should replace it.

Finally, two status fields govern the lifecycle of an item to return:

- The **acceptance status** controls the eligibility of the return per-se. Initially
_pending_, it should end up _accepted_ in case of going forward.
- The **reception status** marks whether the store has already received the
returned package. In a standard scenario, it should transition from _awaiting_
to _received_.

## Customer returns

Finally, after the return authorization has moved forward, it'll materialize in
a customer return. At that point, a store will already have the returned items
back. It might be that the customer support department rejected some of the
requests or accepted all of them.

In Solidus, that's represented by a [`Spree::CustomerReturn`][customer-return]
record. Similar to RMAs, it's a simple model. It only contains an
identification number and a stock location that is a final override of the
RMA's proposal. Customer returns are flexible and not tied to a single return
authorization. Because of that, `Spree::ReturnItem` belongs not only to
`Spree::ReturnAuthorization` but also to `Spree::CustomerReturn`.

## Reimbursements

The final step is fulfilling the store obligations and performing the agreed
reimbursement or exchange. The store will need another shipment with the new
items in the latter case.

[`Spree::Reimbursement`][reimbursement] takes care of wrapping everything up.
It's associated with a `Spree::CustomerReturn`, but the system is flexible
enough so that more than one can be created until all returned items have been
processed.

Typically, administrators can edit the returned item details, like the amount
to refund, the article to use as a substitute, or if it should be marked as
resellable. The system will also take care of creating a new shipment if
needed. In the end, a new reimbursement record will be created with a state of
either reimbursed or errored.
