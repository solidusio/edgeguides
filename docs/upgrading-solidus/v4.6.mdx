# Solidus v4.6 (2025-09-09)

<MinimalRequirements ruby="3.1" rails="7.0" />

We're excited to announce the release of Solidus v4.6.0, packed with improvements across all components of the framework. This release focuses on enhanced email handling, reverse charge VAT support, improved admin UI components, and better Rails compatibility.

## Database Integrity Changes

In this release we included a lot of foreign key migrations to enhance data integrity.

Especially if you are using an old database with lots of orphaned records and an engine that enforces foreign keys (like PostgreSQL) you should carefully review the new migrations and test them in your staging environment before deploying to production.

Each migration file has instructions on how to handle potential issues.

### Example

This migration adds a foreign key to the `spree_user_addresses` table. If there are any orphaned records (i.e. records that reference an address that does not exist), the migration will fail.

```ruby
class AddAddressbookForeignKey < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  ...

  def up
    ...
    add_foreign_key :spree_user_addresses, :spree_addresses, column: :address_id, null: false
  rescue ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid => e
    ...
  end

  def down
    ...
  end
end
```

The commented out code can be used to remove those orphaned records before adding the foreign key constraint.

```ruby
class AddAddressbookForeignKey < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  ...

  def up
    say_with_time "Removing orphaned address book entries (no corresponding address)" do
      Spree::UserAddress.left_joins(:address).where(spree_addresses: { id: nil }).delete_all
    end
    add_foreign_key :spree_user_addresses, :spree_addresses, column: :address_id, null: false
  rescue ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid => e
    ...
  end

  def down
    ...
  end
end
```

:::warning

Please make sure you run these migrations on a staging environment before deploying to production. If you have a large number of orphaned records, the migration might take a while to complete.

### Postgres Users

In Postgres, adding a foreign key blocks writes on both tables. So in large databases extra care should be taken to minimize downtime.
Please update the migrations to use `NOT VALID` by using `validate: false` and then validate the foreign key in a separate step.

```ruby
add_foreign_key :spree_user_addresses, :spree_addresses, column: :address_id, null: false, validate: false
```

Then, after the migration has been run, you can validate the foreign key in a separate migration.

```ruby
validate_foreign_key :spree_user_addresses, :spree_addresses, column: :address_id
```

The same is advised for index changes. By concurrently adding indexes, downtime can be minimized.

```ruby
class ChangeCountriesIsoToUnique < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    remove_index :spree_countries, :iso, algorithm: :concurrently
    add_index :spree_countries, :iso, unique: true, algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```

:::note

You need to disable the transaction for the migration when using `algorithm: :concurrently`.

### Country Iso Uniqueness

In addition to the foreign key migrations, we also added a unique index to the `spree_countries` table on the `iso` column.

If you have duplicate countries in your database, the migration will fail. You can adjust the migration to remove duplicate countries before adding the index.

```ruby
class ChangeCountriesIsoToUnique < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    remove_index :spree_countries, :iso

    say_with_time "Removing duplicate countries" do
      Spree::Country.select(:iso).group(:iso).having("count(*) > 1").pluck(:iso).each do |iso|
        countries = Spree::Country.where(iso: iso).order(:id).to_a
        original_country = countries.shift
        countries.each do |duplicate_country|
          Spree::State.where(country_id: duplicate_country.id).update_all(country_id: original_country.id)
          Spree::Address.where(country_id: duplicate_country.id).update_all(country_id: original_country.id)
          Spree::StockLocation.where(country_id: duplicate_country.id).update_all(country_id: original_country.id)
          Spree::ZoneMember.where(zoneable_type: "Spree::Country", zoneable_id: duplicate_country.id).update_all(zoneable_id: original_country.id)
        end
        puts "  - Removed #{countries.size} duplicate country with ISO code #{iso}"
        countries.each(&:destroy)
      end
    end

    add_index :spree_countries, :iso, unique: true
  end
end
```

:::note

Postgres users, please make sure to add the index concurrently as described above.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### Event-Driven Email System
This release introduces a major refactor of the email system, moving from coupled mailer calls to a flexible event subscriber pattern:

- **New Order Events**: Added comprehensive order lifecycle events for better extensibility
- **Configurable Email Subscribers**: Email sending is now handled by configurable event subscribers, making it easier to customize or replace email behavior
- **Separated Mailer Logic**: Order confirmation, shipping notifications, and cancellation emails are now handled by dedicated subscribers
