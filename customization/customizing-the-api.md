# Customizing the API

## Introduction to the REST API

Solidus comes with a complete [REST API](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/master/api) that allows you to manage all aspects of your store. In some cases, you may want to extend the API's functionality by adding new endpoints and customizing the existing ones. Like all other parts of Solidus, the API is a Rails engine, which means you can use the regular tools at your disposal to customize its behavior.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The API is also used by the default Solidus backend to perform certain tasks without reloading the page. If you are modifying an endpoint's input schema or heavily customizing its output, make sure you are not accidentally breaking your backend! If in doubt, you can always create a new endpoint for your purposes.
{% endhint %}

In this guide, we'll see how to implement a quick-and-dirty API for customers to "like" a certain product, so that you know which products customer like the most. We'll implement a new endpoint for liking a product and we'll add a `likes_count` attribute to the existing [products API](https://solidus.docs.stoplight.io/api-reference/products/list-products).

Let's get started!

## Designing your resources

First of all, we need to make sure users can somehow tell us that they like a product. Because we want this to happen without users having to reload the page, we'll do it via the API.

We could just a `likes_count` column to the `spree_products` table, but in our case we also want to know which users liked which products, so that a product cannot be liked twice by the same user and we can personalize the user's recommendations based on the products they liked. We will also want to make sure that unauthenticated users cannot like a product, because we wouldn't be able to associate that like to a specific customer.

Let's start by creating a new model, `ProductLike`, which we'll use to store the user-product relationship:

```bash
$ rails g model ProductLike user:belongs_to product:belongs_to
```

We'll need to edit the model generated by this command to specify the full namespace of our associated models:

{% code title="app/models/product\_like.rb" %}
```ruby
class ProductLike < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :product, class_name: 'Spree::Product'
  belongs_to :user, class_name: 'Spree::User'
end
```
{% endcode %}

We'll also have to edit the migration manually to specify the correct table names for the foreign keys:

```ruby
class CreateProductLikes < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_table :product_likes do |t|
      t.integer :user_id, null: false
      t.integer :product_id, null: false

      t.foreign_key :spree_users, column: :user_id, on_delete: :cascade
      t.foreign_key :spree_products, column: :product_id, on_delete: :cascade

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Once we're done, we can run the migration with the usual command:

```bash
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, we will add a uniqueness validation to our model, along with a factory and a model spec:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="product\_like.rb" %}
{% code title="app/models/product\_like.rb" %}
```ruby
class ProductLike < ApplicationRecord
  # ...
  validates :user, uniqueness: { scope: :product_id }
end
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="product\_likes.rb" %}
{% code title="spec/factories/product\_likes.rb" %}
```ruby
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :product_like do
    association :user
    association :product
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="product\_like\_spec.rb" %}
{% code title="spec/models/product\_like\_spec.rb" %}
```ruby
RSpec.describe ProductLike do
  it 'has a valid factory' do
    expect(build(:product_like)).to be_valid
  end

  it 'validates the uniqueness of the user/product pair' do
    existing_product_like = create(:product_like)

    product_like = build(:product_like,
      user: existing_product_like.user,
      product: existing_product_like.product,
    )

    expect(product_like).not_to be_valid
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also configure FactoryBot to auto-generate the factory when you create a new model. For more information, refer to the [FactoryBot documentation](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md).
{% endhint %}

Now that we have our model in place, we're ready to start creating an API endpoint for liking products!

## Creating a new endpoint

Implementing a new API endpoint is fairly simple: all we have to do is create a new controller along with its actions, routes and views, just like we would do in a regular Rails application. For our use case, we'll want to create a `ProductLikesController` with a `create` action that allows us to like a product.

{% hint style="info" %}
We could also add a `like` action to the existing `Spree::Api::ProductsController`. However, it's recommended to follow RESTful resource naming when creating new API endpoints. This makes our API easier to understand, consume and maintain.
{% endhint %}

Let's create our controller, along with its view, route a request spec to test it all:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="product\_likes\_controller.rb" %}
{% code title="app/controllers/spree/api/product\_likes\_controller.rb" %}
```ruby
module Spree
  module Api
    class ProductLikesController < Spree::Api::BaseController
      def create
        @product = find_product(params[:product_id])
        @like = ProductLike.new(product: @product, user: current_api_user)

        if @like.save
          render :show, status: :no_content
        else
          invalid_resource!(@like)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

In our controller, we are relying on a few helpers Solidus provides out of the box:

* `find_product` retrieves a product by its numeric ID or slug.
* `current_api_user` retrieves the currently authenticated user \(by default, all API requests require authentication\).
* `invalid_resource!` generates a 422 response that exposes all the error messages on an ActiveModel-compliant object.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="show.json.jbuilder" %}
{% code title="app/views/spree/api/product\_likes/show.json.jbuilder" %}
```ruby
json.user_id(@like.user_id)
json.partial!("spree/api/products/product", product: @like.product)
```
{% endcode %}

In the view, we are using [JBuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder) to create a JSON representation of our `ProductLike` instance. The user ID is represented as an integer, while the product is transformed into a full JSON object by using Solidus' `_product.json.jbuilder` partial.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="routes.rb" %}
{% code title="config/routes.rb" %}
```ruby
# ...
Spree::Core::Engine.routes.draw do
  namespace :api, defaults: { format: 'json' } do
    resources :products do
      resource :product_like, only: :create
    end
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

In the route, you may notice we are using a singleton resource \(`resource :product_like`\) rather than a collection \(`resource :product_likes`\). This is because a user may only have one like for a product. We are also limiting the routes for that resource to the `:create` action, since we are not going to implement the others.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="product\_likes\_spec.rb" %}
{% code title="spec/requests/product\_likes\_spec.rb" %}
```ruby
require 'rails_helper'
require 'spree/api/testing_support/helpers'

RSpec.describe '/api/products/:slug/product_likes', type: :request do
  include Spree::Api::TestingSupport::Helpers
  let(:current_api_user) { create(:user, :with_api_key) }
  before { stub_authentication! }

  describe 'POST /' do

    context 'when the user has not already liked the product' do

      it 'responds with 204 No Content' do
        product = create(:product)

        post spree.api_product_product_like_path(product)

        expect(response.status).to eq(204)
      end

      it 'likes the product' do
        product = create(:product)

        post spree.api_product_product_like_path(product)

        expect(ProductLike.count).to eq(1)
      end
    end

    context 'when the user has already liked the product' do
      it 'responds with 422 Unprocessable Entity' do
        product = create(:product)
        product_like = create(:product_like, user: current_api_user, product: product)

        post spree.api_product_product_like_path(product)

        expect(response.status).to eq(422)
      end

      it 'does not re-like the product' do
        product = create(:product)
        product_like = create(:product_like, user: current_api_user, product: product)

        post spree.api_product_product_like_path(product)

        expect(ProductLike.count).to eq(1)
      end
    end
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

In the spec, we are using the `stub_authentication!` and `current_api_user` helpers, which stub Solidus' authentication mechanism and return the currently authenticated API user.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Solidus provides a lot more partials, helpers and utilities for implementing and testing your API requests. Take a look at the [source code of solidus\_api](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/master/api) to see what's available!
{% endhint %}

At this point, your request spec should be passing, meaning you can integrate it in your frontend and allow users to like products!

## Extending existing resources

As a next step, we'll add a `likes_count` to the `Spree::Product` model and expose it in our API. In order to do this, we first need to add the column to the `spree_products` table:

```bash
$ rails g migration AddLikesCountToSpreeProducts likes_count:integer
```

We will also need to make sure the `likes_count` column is automatically updated with the number of users who have liked the product. In order to do this, we can use ActiveRecord's excellent [counter cache feature](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#options-for-belongs-to-counter-cache). Let's modify the `belongs_to :product` association by enabling the option:

```ruby
class ProductLike < ApplicationRecord
  # ...
  belongs_to :product, class_name: 'Spree::Product', counter_cache: :likes_count
  # ...
end
```

ActiveRecord should now start keeping the number of likes in the `likes_count` column.

In order to expose this field to API clients, we'll need to add a JSON field to the products API. We could just copy-paste the `product.json.jbuilder` view from Solidus and add the field there, but then we would need to remember to update our custom view every time the original view is changed.

Instead, Solidus provides a more manageable way to add attributes to API resources via the `ApiHelpers` module. Let's see how we can do it and test it:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="spree.rb" %}
{% code title="config/initializers/spree.rb" %}
```ruby
# ...
Spree::Api::Config.product_attributes << :likes_count
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="products\_spec.rb" %}
{% code title="spec/requests/api/products\_spec.rb" %}
```ruby
require 'rails_helper'
require 'spree/api/testing_support/helpers'

RSpec.describe '/api/products', type: :request do
  include Spree::Api::TestingSupport::Helpers
  let(:current_api_user) { create(:user, :with_api_key) }
  before { stub_authentication! }

  describe 'GET /:slug' do
    it 'exposes the likes_count field' do
      product = create(:product)
      get spree.api_product_path(product)

      parsed_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      byebug
      expect(parsed_response).to match(a_hash_including('likes_count' => nil))
    end
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

That's all we need! We have created a new API resource and implemented a new endpoint to manipulate it, and we have seen how to add fields to an existing API resource. If you feel adventurous, how about trying to implement an endpoint for _removing_ an existing product like?
