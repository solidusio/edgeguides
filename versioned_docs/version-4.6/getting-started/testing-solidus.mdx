# Testing Solidus

This guide will teach you how to test different aspects of your Solidus application by leveraging
the best practices and tooling provided by Solidus.

## Introduction to testing

For most of the examples in this guide, we have also provided automated tests. While this is a bit
unusual in product documentation, we wanted to give you something you can use as inspiration when
testing your own customizations. Feel free to adapt our tests to fit your own style!

We can't emphasize enough the importance of writing tests for your Solidus app: Solidus is a large,
complex framework, and you are bound to miss gotchas and edge cases when customizing it, no matter
how much QA you do. **Skipping on automated tests means asking for trouble,** especially in
eCommerce, where downtime translates directly into financial loss.

While writing tests may seem like a useless distraction in the short term, it will make you more
productive in the long term, by allowing you to change code faster, with more confidence and with
less manual work. Having good test coverage will also help you tremendously when upgrading Solidus.

## Our testing philosophy

In this paragraph, you'll find some opinionated advice about how to test your Solidus application.
This advice is the result of years spent evolving and maintaining large-scale eCommerce apps, and
will almost certainly be a good starting point for anyone starting to work with Solidus.

### Unit vs. system tests

In general, there's no hard rule on whether something should be tested with a unit test or a system
test. Each developer and development team has its own style and philosophy, and you should find
your own and adapt it over time, as your application grows and your needs evolve.

Our recommendation is to have a balanced test diet: write unit tests for all possible scenarios
\(happy paths, failure paths, edge cases, etc.\), and write system tests for at least the happy path
of all customer- or admin-facing features. This will help you ensure your application is working
well in the real world, and not just when testing each component in isolation.

:::info

We're using "unit tests" in this guide in a loose way to refer to a test that primarily tests a
single module/class rather than its interactions with the rest of the codebase.

:::

In certain cases, you may also want to write lower-level integration tests which don't exercise the
UI, but call multiple components without attempting to isolate them. A good use case would be
testing that a given set of promo rules and actions works as expected when the promotion is applied
to a real order.

### Test coverage

**~80% or higher** is a good test coverage to aim for, but take it with a grain of salt.

In general, coverage metrics are not an optimal measure of test quality, as they don't tell you
anything about where the code is being exercised and how its outputs and side effects are being
measured: you can have very high test coverage and still have tons of blind spots in your
application, because you're calling your code but not verifying its behavior.

Rather than obsessing over test coverage, create guidelines around how to write meaningful,
effective tests. High test coverage will come as a natural byproduct.


## Testing Solidus with Solidus Starter Frontend installed

In case you installed Solidus selecting the Starter Frontend as storefront, you will notice that
you have some specs already in place. You can find them in the `spec` folder of your application.

Most of the steps covered in the rest of the guide are already done for you, but it's still a good
idea to read through the guide to understand how your test suite is configured and the reasons behind
the choices we made.

Please note that the main entry point for the configuration provided by the Starter Frontend is placed
at `spec/solidus_starter_frontend_spec_helper.rb` instead of `spec/spec_helper.rb` and `spec/rails_helper.rb`
as a regular Rails application would do. That's because we wanted to still let the freedom to build your
own test suite, independent from the one we provide.

## Configuring your test environment from scratch

If you didn't use the Starter Frontend and want to start from scratch, here's the bare minimum you'll need
to get started with testing your Solidus app:

```ruby title="Gemfile"
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'factory_bot_rails', '~> 4.8'
end

group :test do
  gem 'capybara', '>= 3.26'
end
```

Let's go over the reason we're recommending these tools and how to set them up.

### Test framework: RSpec

RSpec is the preferred testing framework in the Solidus world. While it's certainly possible to test
a Solidus application with other frameworks \(e.g., MiniTest\), all of our test helpers have been
written to support RSpec, so we strongly recommend using it.

To properly configure RSpec, run the following command after installing the `rspec-rails` gem:

```bash
$ rails g rspec:install
```

After installing RSpec, take a look at `spec/spec_helper.rb` and `spec/rails_helper.rb`, as they
contain some default configurations which you may want to uncomment. At the very least, make sure
you uncomment these lines:

```ruby title="spec/rails\_helper.rb"
Dir[Rails.root.join('spec', 'support', '**', '*.rb')].sort.each { |f| require f }
```

It will automatically load each file in `spec/support` before starting your test suite. This allows
you to import test helpers and configurations from other gems without polluting your main RSpec
configuration.

:::info

Throughout the rest of this guide, we'll assume you are loading files in `spec/support`.

:::

For more information on RSpec and its usage, please see
the [official documentation](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs).

### Factories: FactoryBot

Very often, you'll want to generate an instance of a user, order, product or any other type of
Solidus model in a test. Instead of forcing you to generate the data manually every time, we provide
a set of convenience factories you can import in your app:

```ruby title="config/application.rb"
module AmazingStore
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # ...

    if defined?(FactoryBotRails)
      initializer after: "factory_bot.set_factory_paths" do
        require 'spree/testing_support/factory_bot'

        # The paths for Solidus' core factories.
        solidus_paths = Spree::TestingSupport::FactoryBot.definition_file_paths

        # Optional: Any factories you want to require from extensions.
        extension_paths = [
          # MySolidusExtension::Engine.root.join("lib/my_solidus_extension/testing_support/factories"),
          # or individually:
          # MySolidusExtension::Engine.root.join("lib/my_solidus_extension/testing_support/factories/resource.rb"),
        ]

        # Your application's own factories.
        app_paths = [
          Rails.root.join('spec/factories'),
        ]

        FactoryBot.definition_file_paths = solidus_paths + extension_paths + app_paths
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Finally, you'll want to import the FactoryBot DSL methods. This allows you to call `create`, `build`
, `build_stubbed` and `attributes_for` in your tests without prefixing them with `FactoryBot`:

```ruby title="spec/support/factory\_bot.rb"
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods
end
```

For more information on FactoryBot and its usage, please see
the [official documentation](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot).

### System tests: Capybara

[Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) is an acceptance test framework that simulates
how a real user would interact with your app. Rails uses Capybara to
implement [system tests](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#system-testing), which are
tests where you interact with the UI of your application rather than directly calling individual
modules.

When configured properly, system tests can also execute JavaScript code, just like a real browser
would do. In order for JavaScript to be executed, you'll need to tell Capybara to switch to a
JavaScript-capable browser for JS tests:

```ruby title="spec/support/capybara.rb"
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before(:each, type: :system) do |example|
    if example.metadata[:js]
      driven_by :selenium_chrome_headless
    else
      driven_by :rack_test
    end
  end
end
```

The configuration above tells Capybara to use the default `Rack::Test` browser for non-JS tests, and
Chrome for JS tests. This enables you to do the following:

```ruby title="spec/system/product\_page\_spec.rb"
RSpec.describe "Product page", type: :system do
  it "shows the product's description" do
    visit "/products/solidus-shirt"

    expect(page).to have_text("Solidus-branded T-shirt")
  end

  it "allows me to add a product to my cart", :js do
    visit "/products/solidus-shirt"

    click_button "Add to Cart"

    expect(page).to have_text("Product was added to the cart!")
  end
end
```

In the example above, the first test, which doesn't require JavaScript, will be run
with `Rack::Test`, which is faster. The second test will be run through a headless Chrome instance
with JS capabilities.

For more information on system tests and Capybara, you can refer to
the [RSpec guides](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/5-0/docs/system-specs/system-spec)
and [Capybara's official documentation](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara).

## Using the built-in helpers

Solidus comes with a set of useful helpers you can use in your tests. You can find all of them under
the [`spree/testing_support`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/master/core/lib/spree/testing_support)
path. We suggest including the ones you need in your RSpec configuration to save some time when
writing tests.

:::info

You will notice Solidus has more helpers than we are documenting here. This is because some of the
helpers in `spree/testing_support` are mostly meant for internal use \(i.e., for testing the Solidus
codebase itself\), and wouldn't be very useful in another test suite.

You may still use the undocumented helpers if you find them useful, but keep in mind they may change
over time.

:::

### Authorization helpers

These helpers allow you to bypass
Solidus' [authorization system](../advanced-solidus/permission-management.mdx). This makes testing
easier, since you don't have to stub the current user or the current ability.

In order to use the helpers, first include them in your RSpec configuration:

```ruby title="spec/support/solidus.rb"
# ...

require 'spree/testing_support/authorization_helpers'
```

Once you've included them, you can use them both in controller specs and system specs.

:::caution

Stubbing or customizing the authorization system during testing can lead to unexpected bugs in
production. Instead of stubbing the authorization system, just use Devise's helpers to sign in as a
user with the right permissions.

:::

#### Stubbing the authorization system

The `stub_authorization!` method bypasses the authentication and authorization systems completely by
stubbing the current user and allowing you to perform any action on any resource:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'The product admin' do
  stub_authorization!

  it 'allows me to view the products' do
    product = create(:product)

    visit spree.admin_path
    click_link 'Products'

    expect(page).to have_content(product.name)
  end
end
```

#### Defining a custom authorization block

The `custom_authorization!` method, on the other hand, allows you to define a custom authorization
block. You'll still need to authenticate the current user, if you use it:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'The product admin' do
  custom_authorization! do
    can :read, Spree::Product
  end

  it 'allows me to view the products' do
    sign_in create(:user)
    product = create(:product)

    visit spree.admin_path
    click_link 'Products'

    expect(page).to have_content(product.name)
  end

  it 'does not allow me to edit products' do
    sign_in create(:user)
    product = create(:product)

    visit spree.edit_admin_product_path(product)

    expect(page).to have_content('Access denied')
  end
end
```

\(Note that the [`sign_in` helper](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise#test-helpers) is provided by
Devise, not Solidus.\)

### Capybara helpers

These helpers make it easier to interact with the UI in system specs, especially when testing the
Solidus backend. They can come in really useful if you've customized the backend and want to test
some piece of functionality. They also suppress annoying Puma logs in the test output.

As always, the first step is to include them in your app:

```ruby title="spec/support/solidus.rb"
# ...

require 'spree/testing_support/capybara_ext'
```

#### Interacting with icons

You can use the `click_icon` helper to find and click on a specific FontAwesome icon:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'The option types admin' do
  it 'allows me to delete the option types' do
    sign_in create(:admin_user)
    option_type = create(:option_type)

    visit spree.admin_path
    click_link 'Products'
    click_link 'Option Types'
    click_icon 'trash'

    expect(page).to have_content('has been successfully removed')
  end
end
```

#### Interacting with tables

The `within_row` helper can be used to scope the Capybara context to a specific row within an index
table in the backend:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'The product admin' do
  it 'allows me to edit a product' do
    sign_in create(:admin_user)
    product1 = create(:product)
    product2 = create(:product)

    visit spree.admin_products_path
    # Clicks the edit icon for the first product
    within_row(1) { click_icon 'edit' }

    # ...
  end
end
```

The `column_text` helper can be used to retrieve the text from a specific column in a table row:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'The product admin' do
  it 'displays the product SKU' do
    sign_in create(:admin_user)
    product1 = create(:product)
    product2 = create(:product)

    visit spree.admin_products_path

    within_row(1) do
      expect(column_text(1)).to eq(product1.sku)
    end
  end
end
```

#### Interacting with select2 inputs

The Solidus backend uses the [Select2](https://select2.org/) jQuery plugin for nicer-looking,
Ajax-enabled select boxes. Because Select2 inputs are not regular inputs, some additional code is
required when interacting with them.

You can use the `select2_search` helper to search and select a specific option from a Select2 input
\(this would be equivalent to typing the option's text in the search field, then selecting the
result\):

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'The orders admin' do
  it 'allows me to filter by variant' do
    sign_in create(:admin_user)
    product = create(:product)
    order = create(:order) do |o|
      create(:line_item, order: o, variant: product.master)
    end

    visit spree.admin_orders_path
    select2_search product.sku, from: 'Variant'
    click_button 'Filter results'

    expect(page).to have_content(order.number)
  end
end
```

#### Testing meta tags

You can use the `have_meta` helper to expect the current page to have a specific meta tag:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'The product page' do
  it 'uses the product description in the meta description' do
    product = create(:product)

    visit spree.product_path(product)

    expect(page).to have_meta(:description, product.description)
  end
end
```

### Order helpers

Sometimes, you need to generate an order in a given state. Solidus ships with a set
of [order factories](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v4.1/core/lib/spree/testing_support/factories/order_factory.rb)
you can use to generate different types of orders, and these should be your first choice.

However, you will sometimes need a bit more granularity than what the factories provide \(e.g., when
testing the checkout flow\). A common use case is wanting to generate an order in a certain state,
only with the information the user would have provided up until that state \(e.g., generate an order
in the delivery state, only with address information\). That's exactly what the `OrderWalkthrough`
helper is for.

:::caution

The `OrderWaltkhrough` helper is extremely opinionated: it assumes you haven't modified the order
state machine in significant ways, and that your checkout flow resembles the standard, multi-page
checkout flow from the starter frontend.

If you have altered the order state machine or checkout flow significantly, you may want to use the
order factories instead, or write your own helper, in order for your tests to better resemble
real-world usage.

:::

First of all, include the helper in your test suite:

```ruby title="spec/support/solidus.rb"
# ...

require 'spree/testing_support/order_walkthrough'
```

You can now use the helper whenever you want:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'The checkout flow' do
  it 'renders the delivery step' do
    user = create(:user)
    sign_in user
    # Generate an order in the `delivery` state
    order = Spree::TestingSupport::OrderWalkthrough.up_to(:address)
    order.update!(user: user)

    visit spree.checkout_path

    expect(page).to have_current_path('/checkout/delivery')
  end
end
```

The `OrderWalkthrough.up_to` call will create a new order and it will simulate what a user would do
if they went to the checkout flow and only completed the `address` state. The order will have line
items and an address on it, and it will be in the `delivery` state, ready for shipping method
selection.

### Preference helpers

Sometimes, it can be useful to stub the Solidus configuration, to test how your store would behave
with certain configuration options. This is usually the case for payment methods and other resources
which can be configured by store operators without developer intervention: when that's the case, you
want to make sure operators can't take any action that could cause a store malfunction, which
requires testing under different configurations.

If you need to stub the configuration, first of all require the relevant helper:

```ruby title="spec/support/solidus.rb"
# ...

require 'spree/testing_support/preferences'
```

You can now use the `stub_spree_preferences` helper anywhere in your code. The helper accepts a hash
of preferences, in which case the preferences will be stubbed on the global configuration:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'The product page' do
  it 'renders the price in EUR' do
    # Stub the global `currency` setting of the store
    stub_spree_preferences(currency: 'EUR')
    product = create(:product)

    visit spree.product_path(product)

    expect(page).to have_content('€100,00')
  end

  it 'renders the price in USD' do
    # Stub the global `currency` setting of the store
    stub_spree_preferences(currency: 'USD')
    product = create(:product)

    visit spree.product_path(product)

    expect(page).to have_content('$100.00')
  end
end
```

The helper can also accept a configuration class and a hash of preferences, in which case the
preferences will be stubbed on the provided configuration class:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'The backend' do
  it 'is available in English' do
    # Stub the `locale` setting of the backend
    stub_spree_preferences(Spree::Backend::Config, locale: 'en')

    visit spree.admin_path

    expect(page).to have_content('Email')
  end

  it 'is available in French' do
    # Stub the `locale` setting of the backend
    stub_spree_preferences(Spree::Backend::Config, locale: 'fr')

    visit spree.admin_path

    expect(page).to have_content('Courriel')
  end
end
```

### URL helpers

By default, your tests will not have access to the Solidus routes, because they're part of a Rails
engine and not of your main application. You could access them
with `Spree::Core::Engine.routes.url_helpers`, but you can include the URL helpers if you want to
save a few characters:

```ruby title="spec/support/solidus.rb"
# ...

require 'spree/testing_support/url_helpers'

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include Spree::TestingSupport::UrlHelpers
end
```

You can now access the helpers via the `spree.` shortcut:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'The product page' do
  it 'is accessible' do
    product = create(:product)

    visit spree.product_path(product)

    expect(page).to have_content(product.name)
  end
end
```

## Testing your Solidus app

Since Solidus applications are just regular Rails applications, there's nothing special you need to
do to test them: just write tests as you'd usually do and you'll be fine! With that said, there are
some aspects to keep in mind when testing certain parts of your app, especially if you want to have
an easy time upgrading Solidus.

### Testing service objects

If you have implemented a service object to replace one of Solidus' default implementations, make
sure to test it just as you would do with any other service object.

If you're inheriting from Solidus' default implementation, you should also test any behavior that's
inherited from the original class, to make sure you haven't altered functionality in undesired ways.
This will usually not be needed, because the customizable service objects in Solidus have small,
well-defined interfaces, but keep it in mind!

### Testing overrides

Testing an override is similar to testing a service objects that inherits from the original
implementation: for full test coverage, you'll have to test both your customization and any original
functionality that comes from the default implementation. This will ensure you haven't broken the
original functionality in any way, and it will make it easier to upgrade Solidus.

This kind of gotcha is why you should
prefer [customizing Solidus](../customization/customizing-the-core.mdx) via the extension hooks or
the event bus instead of relying on overrides.

### Testing the storefront

There's nothing special you need to do here: when testing your storefront, do it with system specs,
as you would do for any regular Rails app. Focus on user-facing functionality and integration
testing \(i.e., don't write controller tests unless you have a very good reason to\).

### Testing the backend

Just like for the storefront, you should use system specs for testing your backend customizations.
You may also want to leverage some of the [built-in helpers](testing-solidus.mdx#capybara-helpers)
Solidus provides for testing the backend UI.

### Testing event subscribers

Event-driven behavior is an awesome way to decouple orthogonal logic, but it
can be tricky to test. Take a look at the section about [how to test event
subscribers](../customization/subscribing-to-events.mdx#testing-events) to see
how to do it in Solidus.
