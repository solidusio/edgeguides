# How to add orthogonal behavior to state machines: publishing events

In this guide, we'll see how we can hook into the business flow transitions
orchestrated by a state machine to add behavior that fits into another area
domain.

As noted in the [event bus][event-bus] guide, you can leverage the event bus to
hook into core events. That's helpful when you need to perform something in
response to a change in the system, but your logic is orthogonal (i.e.,
decoupled) to the main flow. Transitions between state machine states are good
candidates to become hotspots where tangential logic is triggered.

:::caution

Don't be confused about state machine events vs. bus events. State machine
events are conditions that can produce a transition between valid states.
They're local to the state machine component. On the other hand, bus events can
be published and consumed anywhere within the system and, per se, have nothing
to do with the state machines.

:::

For instance, you might want to update your ERP or send an SMS when a payment
is marked as completed. The cleaner way to do that is to publish an event when
that happens and then subscribe to it.

First, you need to override the `#complete` state machine event on
`Spree::Payment` (see the [overrides section][customize-core] for the required
setup code):

```ruby title="app/overrides/my_store/publish_payment_completed.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

module MyStore
  module PublishPaymentCompleted
    def complete
      super.tap do |result|
        Spree::Bus.publish(:payment_completed, payment: self) if result
      end
    end

    ::Spree::Payment.prepend self
  end
end
```

The following is an example of a subscriber to the new event:

```ruby title="app/subscribers/my_store/payments_subscriber.rb"
module MyStore
  class PaymentsSubscriber
    include Omnes::Subscriber

    handle :payment_completed,
           with: :notify_payment_completed

    def notify_payment_completed(event)
      payment = event.payload[:payment]
      Notifier.new.notify_payment_completed(payment)
    end
  end
end
```

Don't forget to register the new event and subscribe to it:

```ruby title="config/initializer/events.rb"
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  Spree::Bus.register(:payment_completed)
  MyStore::PaymentsSubriber.new.subscribe_to(Spree::Bus)
end
```

Done. Once the server is restarted, the `:payment_completed` event will be
published every time a payment is completed. That will let its subscriber know
it's time to do their job.

:::info

Ideally, Solidus would publish events for every state machine transition out of the box. Our event
bus is fairly new and we're still working on it, but we'll get there eventually! In the meantime,
you can check`Spree::Bus.registered_events` for the complete list of events that are already
published.
