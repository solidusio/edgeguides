# How to replace an existing state machine

We'll see how you can flat-out replace state machines with your custom
implementation. Not something you'll need every day, as [it comes with its
drawbacks][state-machines-customization], but it can bring you a lot of
flexibility if needed.

A custom state machine can be specified through the `state_machines` option in
`config/initializers/spree.rb`.

For instance, if you wanted to replace the payment state machine, you could
create your own one like this:

```ruby title="lib/my_store/state_machines/payment.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

module MyStore
  class StateMachines
    module Payment
      extend ActiveSupport::Concern

      included do
        state_machine initial: :custom_state do
          # Event, transition & hook definitions
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

And then you'd need to tell Solidus to use it:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
# ...
Spree.config do |config|
  config.state_machines.payment = 'MyStore::StateMachines::Payment'
  # ...
end
```
