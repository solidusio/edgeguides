# How to use Searchkick for search autocomplete

In this guide, we'll see how to improve the autocomplete capabilities offered
by default in [Solidus Starter Frontend][ssf], providing support for large
dataset and advanced features like full-text search, typo tolerance, etc.

This how-to will use a gem called [Searchkick][searchkick-github], which
is one of the most popular choices in the Rails ecosystem.

## Installing Searchkick

Let's get started by adding the necessary gems to our Gemfile:

```
bundle add searchkick elasticsearch
```

:::info

Searchkick supports both Elasticsearch and OpenSearch. This guide
section covers the installation with Elasticsearch. Please, refer to
[Searchkick README][searchkick-github] for more installation options.

## Indexing Configuration

We can now customize our Product model to tell it how its information
should be indexed. We can [customize][override-core] the `Spree::Product`
core model:

```ruby title="app/overrides/my_store/spree/product/add_searchkick.rb"
module AmazingStore
  module Spree
    module Product
      module AddSearchkick
        def self.prepended(base)
          unless base.respond_to?(:searchkick_index)
            base.searchkick word_start: [:name]
          end
        end

        def search_data
          { name: name }
        end

        def should_index?
          kept?
        end

        ::Spree::Product.prepend self
      end
    end
  end
end
```

A brief explanation about what we just added to the
`Spree::Product` model:

- `searchkick word_start: [:name]` enables Searchkick for this
  model. `word_start: [:name]` will index the name of the product
  in a special way that allows a partial match with the initial
  part of the string. By default, it matches the entire word.
  We will see later why we need this.
- `unless base.respond_to?(:searchkick_index)` conditional surrounds
  the statement above to avoid Searchkick to try to load itself multiple
  times in development, where the code is reloaded at each new request.
- `search_data` tells Searchkick which fields we want to index.
  For this example, `name` is enough but you could consider adding
  more fields depending on your needs.
- `should_index?` determines which records will be indexed. In this
  case, to keep it simple we only index products that are not
  soft-deleted.

Now that we've got the basis, it's time for our first real indexing.
Opening a Rails console, we can run:

```ruby title="bin/rails c"
Spree::Product.reindex
```

:::info

Be sure you have Elasticsearch up and running. Please, follow the
official [installation instructions][elasticsearch-install-guide],
or if you are a MacOS and Homebrew user, just run:

```sh
brew install elastic/tap/elasticsearch-full
brew services start elasticsearch-full
```

:::

At this point, we can verify that a basic search is working.
Assuming you have some products which include the `ruby`
word in one of the indexed fields, you can run:

```ruby title="bin/rails c"
Spree::Product.search("ruby").map(&:name)
# => ["Ruby Hoodie", "Ruby Polo", "Ruby Mug", "Ruby Tote", "Ruby Hoodie Zip"]
```

Yey, it works! ðŸŽ‰

Time to index our categories as well:

```ruby title="app/overrides/my_store/spree/taxon/add_searchkick.rb"
module AmazingStore
  module Spree
    module Taxon
      module AddSearchkick
        def self.prepended(base)
          unless base.respond_to?(:searchkick_index)
            base.searchkick word_start: [:name]
          end
        end

        def search_data
          { name: name }
        end

        ::Spree::Taxon.prepend self
      end
    end
  end
end
```

We can now run a reindex for `Spree::Taxon` and verify it's
working:

```ruby title="bin/rails c"
Spree::Taxon.reindex
Spree::Taxon.search("ruby").map(&:name)
# => ["Ruby"]
```

## Enhancing search autocomplete

[Solidus Starter Frontend][ssf] comes with a simple search autocomplete out of
the box. In this section of the guide, we will change its behavior to use the
newly added advanced search functionalities.

:::info

The search autocomplete feature has been added to the Starter Frontend
since Solidus 3.4.0. If you don't have it, please refer to
[Autocomplete main search with products and taxons][autocomplete-pr] to
backport that feature in your storefront.

:::

To let the autocomplete controller use Searchkick, we need to change the
code of the `AutocompleteResultsController` provided like this:

```diff title="app/controllers/autocomplete_results_controller.rb"

  def autocomplete_products
    if params[:keywords].present?
-      searcher = build_searcher(params.merge(per_page: 5))
-      searcher.retrieve_products
+      Spree::Product.search(params[:keywords], fields: [{name: :word_start}], limit: 5)
    else
      Spree::Product.none
    end
  end

  def autocomplete_taxons
    if params[:keywords].present?
-       Spree::Taxon
-         .where(Spree::Taxon.arel_table[:name].matches("%#{params[:keywords]}%"))
-         .limit(5)
+       Spree::Taxon.search(params[:keywords], fields: [{name: :word_start}], limit: 5)
    else
      Spree::Taxon.none
    end
  end
```

- `fields: [{name: :word_start}]` part is required to tell Searchkick that we
  want to use the special index for partial matching, previously defined in
  the models.


With just these small changes, the autocomplete will finally use Searchkick
under the hood.


## Next steps

We just scratched the surface of what's possible with Searchkick, and
it's left to each store to implement the configuration that better suits
its needs. Still, there are some big things worth considering and in
this section, we'll see the most relevant for a typical Solidus store.

:::info

[Searchkick README][searchkick-github] is really well done and contains
more details about the information reported in this guide. Please, always
refer to that documentation to get extended and updated information.

:::


### Reindex Strategies

By default, every time you change a record if Searchkick is enabled
on that model, a reindex will be triggered for that record only.
While this is very useful, it can hurt stores' performances.

To mitigate this problem, it is suggested to use the Asynchronous
Reindex Strategy, which will push the update to a background job.

:::info

Please refer to Rails' [Active Job][active-job] guide to setup your
system for background jobs support.

:::

To enable this strategy, you can edit the directive that enabled
Searchkick on the models, like this:

```diff title="app/overrides/my_store/spree/product/add_searchkick.rb"
-   base.searchkick word_start: [:name]
+   base.searchkick word_start: [:name], callbacks: :async
```

### Reindex Associations

Another important aspect of automatic reindexing is how
associations are reindexed. In fact, data is not automatically
synced when an association is updated. This is useful if the
information indexed for a given record depends on the state of
another resource of your application, associated with that record.

For example, imagine you only want to index products that have
stock in your warehouses. You can easily add this behavior using
the `should_index?` method as we saw before:


```diff title="app/overrides/my_store/spree/product/add_searchkick.rb"
    def should_index?
-     kept?
+     kept? && total_on_hand > 0
    end
```

:::info

`total_on_hand` checks all the product variants' stock levels via a
model called Spree::StockItem. This model contains all the information
about the remaining stock for a given variant in a given warehouse.

:::

Nice and clean, but what if someone purchases that product and its stock
goes to 0?

We need to also tell Solidus to reindex products associated with the
corresponding StockItem, every time they get an update.

```ruby title="app/overrides/my_store/spree/stock_item/reindex_product_on_change.rb"
module AmazingStore
  module Spree
    module StockItem
      module ReindexProductOnChange
        def self.prepended(base)
          base.after_commit :reindex_product
        end

        private

        def reindex_product
          variant.product.reindex
        end

        ::Spree::StockItem.prepend self
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Now, every time a stock level changes, the system will reindex the
corresponding product to determine if it's still eligible to be part of the
autocomplete search results.

### Completely replace Solidus Search with Searchkick.

You might be wondering why we are using these powerful Searchkick capabilities
for autocomplete results only instead of replacing the whole Solidus searcher
to use this new approach. That's a good point, actually!

Unfortunately, replacing the whole searcher with Searchkick properly requires us
to support a lot of other features, like filtering products per taxons, accepting
scopes already defined on `Spree::Products` and many other things that would have
made this how-to way more complex. We'll leave here an initial implementation idea,
which only replaces the matching keyword logic from ActiveRecord to Searchkick.

First of all, let's restore using the searcher in the autocomplete results controller
for products:

```diff title="app/controllers/autocomplete_results_controller.rb"
  def autocomplete_products
    if params[:keywords].present?
-      Spree::Product.search(params[:keywords], fields: [{name: :word_start}], limit: 5)
+      searcher = build_searcher(params.merge(per_page: 5))
+      searcher.retrieve_products
    else
      Spree::Product.none
    end
  end
```

Now, we can create our own custom searcher based on Searchkick:

```ruby title="app/models/my_store/searchkick_searcher.rb"
module MyStore
  class SearchkickSearcher < Spree::Core::Search::Base
    protected

    def get_products_conditions_for(base_scope, query)
      unless query.blank?
        searchkick_products = Spree::Product.search(query, fields: [{name: :word_start}])
        base_scope.where(ids: searchkick_products.pluck(:id))
      end
      base_scope
    end
  end
end
```

As you can see, this class inherits from [the core searcher][base-searcher],
and replaces just the method responsible for filtering results by the keyword
passed to the searcher.

As the final step, we can tell Solidus to use this class with the proper configuration:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  config.searcher_class = 'MyStore::SearchkickSearcher'
  # ...
end
```

That's it. Now, if you want, you can iterate and replace more parts of the searcher
using Searchkick.
