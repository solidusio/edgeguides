# How to setup Colorado Delivery Fee

Solidus taxation system supports the [Colorado retail delivery fee][colorado-delivery-fee]
out of the box. In this how-to, we will see the steps required to configure your store to enable this tax.

## Via Admin Panel

1. Create a new Zone for the state of Colorado.
2. Create a new TaxRate within that zone, with:
  - The new Colorado Zone as its zone.
  - A rate of `0.27`.
  - `Order Level` as `Tax Rate Level`.
  - `FlatFee` as its base calculator.

## Via rake task

Solidus also provides a [rake task][rake-task] to help with the process. It will add the
new Tax Rate to the default Tax Category if it exists. To execute it, please run:

```bash
bin/rails taxes:colorado_delivery_fee
```
