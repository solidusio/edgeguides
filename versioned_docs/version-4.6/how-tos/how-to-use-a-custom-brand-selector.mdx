# Introduction
Brands are a frequently required information in ecommerce. 
They allow 
* more comprehensive analytics;
* They allow your customers to filter products from a certain manufacturer;
* They are frequently used in product feeds for marketing platforms such as Google Shopping. 

With the integration of Brands inside Solidus all above detailed scenarios are possible. 

# How to Use a Custom Brand Selector

In Solidus, a product's brand is determined using a configurable `brand_selector_class`. By default, this is set to `Spree::TaxonBrandSelector`, which identifies the brand by associating the product with a taxon under the taxonomy named `"Brands"`.

This guide explains how to implement and configure a custom brand selector to suit your application's unique requirements.

## Default Behavior

By default, the `Spree::TaxonBrandSelector` works as follows:

- It fetches all taxons associated with a product.
- It filters the taxons by checking if they belong to the `"Brands"` taxonomy.
- It returns the first matching taxon as the brand.

Here is the default configuration:

```ruby
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...
  config.brand_selector_class = 'Spree::TaxonBrandSelector'
end
```

# Implementing a Custom Brand Selector

To override the default behavior, you can create a new class that implements the same interface as `Spree::TaxonBrandSelector`.

For example, let's say you want to define brands based on specific product properties rather than taxons. Here's how you can do it:

## Step 1: Create Your Custom Class

```ruby title="app/models/my_store/custom_brand_selector.rb"
module MyStore
  class CustomBrandSelector
    def initialize(product)
      @product = product
    end

    def call
      # Replace this with your custom logic.
      # For instance, returning a specific brand based on a product's property:
      @product.custom_brand_property
    end

    private

    attr_reader :product
  end
end
```

## Step 2: Update the Configuration

To use your custom brand selector, update the initializer to configure the `brand_selector_class`:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...
  config.brand_selector_class = 'MyStore::CustomBrandSelector'
end
```


## Verifying the Custom Behavior

Once you've implemented and configured your custom class, you can verify its behavior by calling the `brand` method on any product. This method will now use your custom selector logic:

```ruby title="Example: Verifying Custom Brand Selector"
product = Spree::Product.find(1)
puts product.brand # Outputs the result of your custom logic
```
