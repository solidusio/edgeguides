# Solidus v4.4 (2024-11-12)

<MinimalRequirements ruby="3.1" rails="7.0" />

Solidus v4.4 is out! ðŸŽ‰

This release continues [the amazing work](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AMadelineCollier+is%3Aclosed) from [Madeline](https://github.com/MadelineCollier) to finalize the new Solidus Admin interface, adds Rails 7.2 support and introduces a new promotion system for new stores.

## <PRLink number="5805">Hello, `solidus_promotions`</PRLink>

A major new development is the release of `solidus_promotions` and `solidus_legacy_promotions`.
Solidus' promotion system, while very flexible and one of the major selling points of the system,
has grown over the years and needed a complete overhaul. This overhaul comes with some behavior change
that reflects our learnings over many years of deploying Spree and Solidus. It comes with performance
improvements, easier-to-read code and features that were hard or impossible to implement with the legacy
promotion system (such as stackable discounts).

However, the refactoring introduced changes in behavior to the promotion system, and it turned out to
be easier to create a new promotion system gem and extract the current one into a gem. The new promotion system,
[`solidus_promotions`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v4.4/promotions/), will be Solidus' default from
Solidus 5. The legacy promotion system has been extracted into its own gem, `solidus_legacy_promotions`.

Now, if your store depends on the full `solidus` suite of gems and you are upgrading a store with promotions,
things should just work. Some of the promotion configuration endpoints have changed, but these will emit friendly
deprecation messages telling you which changes to make.

If, however, your Gemfile specifies only `solidus_core` and any other gems that might be part of the suite, you *must*
also add `solidus_legacy_promotions` as a dependency in order for your store to continue to work. Once that is done, your
store should work as before.

If setting up a new store, we recommend starting out with the new promotion system. Add

```
gem "solidus_promotions", "~> 4.4"
```

to your Gemfile and follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v4.4/promotions/README.md).

If you want to upgrade your store to the new promotion system, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v4.4/promotions/MIGRATING.md)

## <PRLink number="5843">Rails 7.2 support</PRLink>

This made it necessary to bump the minimum Ruby version to 3.1 as well. Upgrading your store to Ruby 3.1 should be easy and you probably already have done it.

## Moving `solidus_user_roles` extension into core and admin

We started to move the `solidus_user_roles` extension into core and the new admin. The new migrations check the existence of the tables, so it should be save to install
even if you have the extension installed, which you still need if you are using the current `solidus_backend` admin.
