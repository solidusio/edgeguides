# Image processing

## Architecture overview

In a typical Solidus store, you can upload images for products and taxons.

Under the hood, Solidus will use a different file processing library depending on the Rails
version: [Active Storage](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) is the
default starting from Rails 6.1,
while [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip#paperclip) is used in earlier versions.

:::caution

Active Storage cannot be used in Rails 6.0 or earlier because it doesn't support public URLs, which
Solidus needs to serve images to your users. If you're on Rails 6.0 or earlier, you _have_ to use
Paperclip.

:::

While Paperclip is deprecated and will be removed in the near future, Solidus provides a
compatibility layer that abstracts the differences between the two libraries, in order to offer an
easier migration path to existing Paperclip users.

## Customizing image sizes

By default, Solidus uses the following sizes for product images:

* `mini`: 48x48
* `small`: 400x400
* `product`: 680x680
* `large`: 1200x1200

and the following sizes for taxon icons:

* `mini`: 32x32
* `normal`: 128x128

You can access the URL for a specific size by calling `Spree::Image#url`:

```ruby
image = Spree::Product.first.gallery.images.first
image.url(:product)
```

If you're building a custom storefront, you may also want to change the sizes of
the images in your store or add additional sizes. The default sizes can be changed
using the `Spree::Config.product_image_styles` option.

For example, we can set some new defaults and introduce a new `:jumbo` style
like this:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...
  config.product_image_styles = {
    mini: '48x48>',
    small: '100x100>',
    product: '240x240>',
    large: '600x600>',
    jumbo: '1600x1600>'
  }
end
```

Similar to product styles, you can customize the taxon image styles using the
`Spree::Config.taxon_image_styles` configuration option.

:::caution

Active Storage will automatically generate sizes upon initial request.
If you change the default image sizes and are using Paperclip, you must
regenerate the styles by running a Rake task:

```bash
bundle exec rake paperclip:refresh:thumbnails CLASS=Spree::Image
```

or if you are only adding new styles, you can run the following task:

```bash
bundle exec rake paperclip:refresh:missing_styles CLASS=Spree::Image
```

:::

Now that you changed your sizes, try getting the URL for your new `jumbo` or `mini` sizes:

```ruby
image = Spree::Product.first.gallery.images.first
image.url(:jumbo)

icon = Spree::Taxon.first.icon
icon.url(:mini)
```

You can also use your new styles in the `image` partial in the backend:

```ruby
<%= render 'spree/admin/shared/image', image: product.gallery.images.first, size: :jumbo %>
```

and if you are using `solidus_starter_frontend` for your storefront like this:

```ruby
<%= render(
  ImageComponent.new(
    image: product.gallery.images.first,
    size: :jumbo,
    itemprop: "image",
    data: { js: 'product-main-image' }
  )
) %>
```

## Customizing the allowed MIME types

By default, Solidus only accepts PNG, JPEG and GIF images. If you want to accept additional MIME
types, e.g. WebP, you can do it via the `allowed_image_mime_types` configuration option:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.allowed_image_mime_types = %w(image/jpeg image/jpg image/png image/gif image/webp).freeze
end
```

## Replacing an attachment module

If the change you want to apply cannot be made through the existing configuration options, you can
entirely replace the product image or taxon icon attachment module with your own.

This can be useful, for example, if you need to customize your image styles or perform custom
post-processing operations on your image such as watermarking, compression, etc.

:::info

When replacing an attachment module, we recommend copy-pasting the original module first and only
changing what you need. The right starting point will depend on whether you're using ActiveStorage
or Paperclip. You can find the modules
for `Spree::Image` [here](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/image)
and the modules
for `Spree::Taxon` [here](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/taxon).

:::

Here's an example for the product image attachment:

```ruby title="app/models/amazing\_store/image\_attachment.rb"
module AmazingStore
  module ImageAttachment
    # ...
  end
end
```

Once you have your custom attachment module, you need to tell Solidus to use it:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...
  config.image_attachment_module = 'AmazingStore::ImageAttachment'
end
```

To replace the taxon attachment, follow the same process, but set the `taxon_attachment_module`
configuration option instead.
