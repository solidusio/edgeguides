# Solidus v4.1 (2023-06-29)

<MinimalRequirements ruby="3.0" rails="7.0" />

Solidus v4.1 is out! ðŸŽ‰

This release is relatively tiny and should be quite easy to upgrade. It starts to lay down the foundational
work for the new Admin, which will be delivered gradually during the rest of the v4.x releases.

In fact, with v4.1, stores can switch their Admin to the new color scheme, and allow operators to start
getting used to it, reducing the impact of future changes.

Let's see in detail the main things to be aware of when upgrading.

:::info

Please, when upgrading, remember to review our generic [upgrade guides](/upgrading-solidus/index.mdx) and run:

```
bin/rails g solidus:update
```

You can also check the complete [Changelog](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/blob/v4.1/CHANGELOG.md) in our repository.

:::

## <PRLink number="5092">Add a new admin theme</PRLink>

https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/5092 is the first step towards the new Admin. It introduces a new
theme, which is a set of colors and styles that can be applied to the Admin.

To switch to the new theme, you can set the following preference:

```
Spree::Backend::Config.theme = 'solidus_admin'
```

## <PRLink number="5110">Allow changing the order recalculator</PRLink>

The `order.recalculate` and `order.recalculator` are introduced as aliases to the now deprecated
`order.update` and `order.updater` in order to clarify the intention of these methods.

This change also adds a preference to change the order recalculator (also known as order updater).
If your store has any customization of the order recalculator, you can evaluate creating
your own class that inherits from the current OrderUpdater class and set the new preference as:

```
Spree::Config.order_recalculator_class = 'YourCustomOrderRecalucator'
```

## <PRLink number="5158">Remove respond_to :html from Spree::BaseController</PRLink>

When we removed the gem `responders` as a core dependency (it still is for backend and api),
we forgot to move the `respond_to :html` statement from `Spree::BaseController`, which is part
of core.

This change cleans up this discrepancy, but when updating please be aware that your custom code
could be broken if these statements are true together:

- You have a controller inheriting from Spree::BaseController.
- You are making use of responders in that controller.
- You are also using the `:html` format.
- And you are not explicitly adding the `:html` format.

If that's the case, you can just add `respond_to :html` in that controller to fix it.

## <PRLink number="5152">Allow lambda in menu item :match_path option and URL</PRLink>

This change allows setting a path for a menu item via a lambda executed at runtime. If engines other than Solidus
would like their route in the main menu, this is how they can do it dynamically without having to hard-code the path.
Similarly, we allow the `match_path` option for Menu Items to be a callable taking a request.

You can now do:

```ruby
Spree::Backend::Config.configure do |config|
  config.menu_items << config.class::MenuItem.new(
    [:admin, :my_custom_controller],
    'my_custom_controller',
    url: ->(_request) { # do something to generate the menu item's URL },
    match_path: ->(_request) { # do something to match the path and highlight the menu item }
  )
end
```

If you have any customization for setting complex `path`s and `match_path`s in your Admin menu items,
it's time to remove them and switch to this method.
