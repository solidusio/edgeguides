# How to use a custom promotion adjuster

Every time an order is updated, its eligible promotions might
not be valid anymore; for example, this could happen if a promotion is
tight to a specific order total threshold, and this value changes within
the update. In the same way, changing the order could make it eligible
for new promotions.

In this guide, we'll see how to use our custom logic to recalculate adjustments every time an
order is updated.

In Solidus, this behavior is encapsulated in the
[`Spree::Promotion::OrderAdjustmentsRecalculator`][order_adjustments_recalculator],
class, which is called every time the order is updated. This class iterates over all
existing promotion adjustments and recalculates their amount and eligibility.

:::caution

Please, keep in mind that promotion adjustments are handled before taxes are
calculated, such that taxes always respect promotions.

:::

We'll now see how to use our own class instead of the one provided
by Solidus.

First of all, let's declare which promotion adjuster class we want to
use, with the corresponding configuration:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...
  config.promotion_adjuster_class = 'MyStore::PromotionAdjuster'
end
```

Lastly, let's create our custom class, which implements the same interface
of the original promotion adjuster class provided by Solidus:

```ruby title="app/models/my_store/promotion_adjuster.rb"
module MyStore
  class PromotionAdjuster
    def initialize(order)
      @order = order
    end

    def call
      # Your custom logic here.
    end
  end
end
```

:::info

Keep in mind that if you define your class as:

```ruby
class PromotionAdjuster < ::Spree::Promotion::OrderAdjustmentsRecalculator
```

you will be able to use `super` in its methods to execute parts of the
original class provided by Solidus.
