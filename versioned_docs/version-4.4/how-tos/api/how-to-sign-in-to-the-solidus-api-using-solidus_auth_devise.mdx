# How to sign in to the Solidus API using solidus_auth_devise

We'll learn how to leverage a common dependency on Solidus,
[solidus_auth_devise][solidus_auth_devise], to also provide the initial
email/password authentication for the Solidus API.

We need to create the controller to handle the sign in, inheriting from the
standard [`Devise::SessionsController`][devise_sessions_controller]:

```ruby title="app/controllers/spree/api/user_sessions_controller.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

class Spree::Api::UserSessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  clear_respond_to && respond_to(:json)

  def after_sign_in_path_for(_resource)
    nil
  end
end
```

There are a few important things to notice here:

* We're skipping the `verify_authenticity_token` as with any other API
requests.
* We're configuring the controller to only respond to JSON requests. First, we
need to clear the previous configuration inherited from solidus_auth_devise.
The `clear_respond_to` && `respond_to` methods come from the [`responders`
gem][responders], which is a dependency used by devise.
* We're overriding the `after_sign_in_path_for` method to return `nil` in order
to avoid any redirection attempt after sign in. That's a hook used by devise.

Let's now configure devise in the routes:

```ruby title="config/routes.rb"
# ...
  namespace :api do
    devise_scope :spree_user do
      post '/sign_in', to: '/spree/api/user_sessions#create', format: false, defaults: { format: :json }
    end
  end
# ...
```

The `devise_scope` method is used to tell devise which user scope needs to be
handled in the route defined within. For the declared route, we ensure that
`:json` is the default format and that no others can be requested.

We can now test the sign in endpoint. After restarting the server, we can run:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -v -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:3000/api/sign_in  -d '{"spree_user": {"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "test123" }}'
```

Given that the user exists, we should get a response similar to:

```bash
{"id":1,"email":"admin@example.com","persistence_token":null,"perishable_token":null,"last_request_at":null,"login":"admin@example.com","ship_address_id":null,"bill_address_id":null,"created_at":"2023-02-02T04:54:14.867Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T15:24:09.962Z","spree_api_key":"fbfd90eb1b323fbcdebf59fe9280917b4e2c80569e2d4aed","authentication_token":null,"deleted_at":null}
```

For Rails 7 onward, we still need to do an adjustment to work with the unhappy
path (see [issue on the Devise repository][issue_devise]):

```ruby title="config/initializers/devise.rb"
# ...
Devise.setup do |config|
  # ...
  config.navigational_formats = ['*/*', :html, :turbo_stream]
end
```

After restarting once more the server, let's try to sign in with invalid credentials:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -v -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:3000/api/sign_in  -d '{"spree_user": {"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "invalid" }}'
```

We should now get:

```bash
{"error":"Invalid email or password."}
```

## Customizing the success response

The default response for a successful sign in is the user instance serialized
as JSON. However, we can create our own view to change it:

:::info
We're using here [jbuilder][jbuilder], which is already a dependency on
solidus-api, but you can use any other templating engine.
:::

```ruby title="app/views/spree/api/user_sessions/create.json.jbuilder"
json.attributes([:email, :spree_api_key])
```

Let's try again:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -v -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:3000/api/sign_in  -d '{"spree_user": {"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "test123" }}'
{"attributes":["email","spree_api_key"]}
```

## Customizing the failure response

We can also customize the response for a failed sign in. For that, we need to
configure the so-called [failure application][failure_application] that
[warden][warden], the engine underlining devise, uses. We can override the
default behavior via inheritance:

```ruby title="lib/auth_failure_app.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

class AuthFailureApp < Devise::FailureApp
 def http_auth_body
    return super unless request_format == :json

    {
      success: false,
      message: i18n_message
    }.to_json
  end
end
```

Let's inform warden to use it from the devise initializer:

```ruby title="config/initializers/devise.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

require 'auth_failure_app'

# ...
  config.warden do |manager|
    manager.failure_app = AuthFailureApp
  end
# ...
```

After restarting the server, we can now confirm that the response on failure has changed:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -v -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:3000/api/sign_in  -d '{"spree_user": {"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "invalid" }}'
{"success":false,"message":"Invalid email or password."}
```
