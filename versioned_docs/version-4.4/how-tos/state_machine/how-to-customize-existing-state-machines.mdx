# How to customize existing state machines

Sometimes you might need to tweak Solidus' core model to fit your business
needs. In that case, you might want to tweak a state machine to obey your
extended domain.

Say that you must store the time when a payment has been marked as completed.
First, you need to add a new `#completed_at` field to the payments table:

```bash
bin/rails g migration AddCompletedAtToSpreePayments completed_at:time
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Next, you can leverage the payment state machine to fill it. You can add an
`after_transition hook` using an [override][customize-core] (don't forget the setup code in `config/application.rb`):

```ruby title="app/overrides/my_store/payment_set_completed_at.rb"
# frozen_string_literal: true

module MyStore
  module PaymentSetCompletedAt
    def self.prepended(base)
      base.state_machine.after_transition(to: :completed) do
        self.completed_at = Time.zone.now
      end
    end

    ::Spree::Payment.prepend self
  end
end
```

That's all you need to do. From this moment, the state machine will be
responsible for storing when a payment is completed.

Be aware of not overusing transition hooks in the state machines. When the involved logic requires
reaching external services or, more generally, is decoupled from the main flow, you're better
off [leveraging the event bus][how-to-add-orthogonal-behavior]. Otherwise, you
will eventually run into the typical gotchas and downsides of abusing
`ActiveRecord` callbacks.
