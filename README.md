# Solidus Developer Documentation

This repository hosts the developer documentation for Solidus, the open-source eCommerce framework for industry
trailblazers.

The documentation, which is still a work in progress, is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) and
published to https://edgeguides.solidus.io.

## Installation

```
$ yarn
```

## Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without
having to restart the server.

## Deployment

There's nothing special to do here: this website is published via Cloudflare Pages. All PRs generate a preview
environment, and all commits to `main` will cause the main site to be rebuilt.

## Contributing

To organize the documentation and make it more usable, the guides follow the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/)
framework. If you are planning on making significant contributions, we strongly recommend getting familiar
with Diátaxis' taxonomy and conventions.
